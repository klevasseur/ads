<div class="para">Imagine that you were told that there is a large sum of money behind one of two doors marked A and B, and that one of the two propositions <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> is true and the other is false. Which door would you choose? All that you need to realize is that if <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> is true, then <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> will also be true. Since we know that this can’t be the case, <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> must be the true proposition and the money is behind Door B.</div>
