<body class="ignore-math"><article class="example example-like"><div class="para">Consider the polynomial <span class="process-math">\(f(x) = x^2-2\)</span> taken as being in <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{Q}\)</span>[x]. From high school algebra we know that <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\)</span> has two zeros (or roots), namely <span class="process-math">\(\pm \sqrt{2}\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(x^2 - 2\)</span> can be factored  as <span class="process-math">\(\left(x - \sqrt{2}\right) \left(x + \sqrt{2}\right)\text{.}\)</span> However, we are working in <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{Q}[x]\text{,}\)</span> these two factors are not in the set of polynomials over the rational numbers, <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{Q}\)</span>  since <span class="process-math">\(\sqrt{2} \notin \mathbb{Q}\)</span> .   Therefore, <span class="process-math">\(x^2 - 2\)</span> does not have a zero in <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{Q}\)</span> since it cannot be factored over <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{Q}\text{.}\)</span> When this happens, we say that the polynomial is irreducible over <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{Q}\text{.}\)</span>
