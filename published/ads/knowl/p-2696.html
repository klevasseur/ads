<li><div class="para">A sequence is often called a  <em class="emphasis">discrete function</em>.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Although it is important to keep in mind that a sequence is a function, another useful way of visualizing a sequence is as a list. For example, the sequence <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> in the previous example could be written as <span class="process-math">\((0, 0, 2, 6, 12, 20, \dots )\text{.}\)</span> Finite sequences can appear much the same way when they are the input to or output from a computer. The index of a sequence can be thought of as a time variable. Imagine the terms of a sequence flashing on a screen every second. Then <span class="process-math">\(s_k\)</span> would be what you see in the <span class="process-math">\(k^{th}\)</span> second. It is convenient to use terminology like this in describing sequences. For example, the terms that precede the <span class="process-math">\(k^{th}\)</span> term of <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> would be <span class="process-math">\(A (0), A(1), . . . , A(k -1)\text{.}\)</span>  They might be called the earlier terms.</div></li>
