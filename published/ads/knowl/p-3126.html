<div class="para">Each edge is an ordered pair of elements from the vertex set. The first entry is the <dfn class="terminology">initial vertex</dfn> of the edge and the second entry is the <dfn class="terminology">terminal vertex</dfn>. Despite the set terminology in this definition, we often think of a graph as a picture, an aid in visualizing a situation. In Chapter 6, we introduced this concept to help understand relations on sets. Although those relations were principally of a mathematical nature, it remains true that when we see a graph, it tells us how the elements of a set are related to one another.  We have chosen not to allow a graph with an empty vertex set, the so-called empty graph.   There are both advantages and disadvantages to allowing the empty graph, so you may encounter it in other references.</div>
