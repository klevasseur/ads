<div class="para">A network of computers can be described easily using a graph.  <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-undirected-1.html" title="Figure 9.1.8">Figure 9.1.8</a> describes a network of five computers, <span class="process-math">\(a\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(b\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(c\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(d\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(e\text{.}\)</span> An edge between any two vertices indicates that direct two-way communication is possible between the two computers. Note that the edges of this graph are not directed. This is due to the fact that the relation that is being displayed is symmetric (i.e., if <span class="process-math">\(X\)</span> can communicate with <span class="process-math">\(Y\text{,}\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\(Y\)</span> can communicate with <span class="process-math">\(X\)</span>). Although directed edges could be used here, it would simply clutter the graph.</div> <div class="sidebyside"><div class="sbsrow" style="margin-left:0%;margin-right:0%;">

</div></div> <div class="para">This undirected graph, in set terms,  is <span class="process-math">\(V = \{a, b, c, d, e\}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(E = \{\{a, b\}, \{a, d\}, \{b, c\}, \{b, d\}, \{c, e\}, \{b, e\}\}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">There are several other situations for which this graph can serve as a model. One of them is to interpret the vertices as cities and the edges as roads, an abstraction of a map such as the one in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-undirected-2.html" title="Figure 9.1.9">Figure 9.1.9</a> . Another interpretation is as an abstraction of the floor plan of a house.  See <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/exercise-house-9-1.html" title="Exercise 9.1.5.11">Exercise 9.1.5.11</a>. Vertex <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> represents the outside of the house; all others represent rooms. Two vertices are connected if there is a door between them.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="s-graphs-introduction.html#ex-undirected-1" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
