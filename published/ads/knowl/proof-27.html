<div class="para logical">
<div class="para">(<span class="process-math">\(\Rightarrow\)</span>) Let <span class="process-math">\(G = (V, E)\)</span> be a bipartite graph that is partitioned into two sets,  R(ed) and  B(lue) that define a 2-coloring. Consider any circuit in <span class="process-math">\(V\text{.}\)</span> If we specify a direction in the circuit and define  <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> on the vertices of the circuit by</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
f(u) = \textrm{the next vertex in the circuit after } v
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">Note that <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is a bijection. Hence the number of red vertices in the circuit equals the number of blue vertices, and so the length of the circuit must be even.</div>
</div> <div class="para">(<span class="process-math">\(\Longleftarrow\)</span>) Assume that <span class="process-math">\(G\)</span> has no circuit of odd length. For each component of <span class="process-math">\(G\text{,}\)</span> select any vertex <span class="process-math">\(w\)</span> and color it red. Then for every other vertex <span class="process-math">\(v\)</span> in the component, find the path of shortest distance from <span class="process-math">\(w\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(v\text{.}\)</span> If the length of the path is odd, color <span class="process-math">\(v\)</span> blue, and if it is even, color <span class="process-math">\(v\)</span> red. We claim that this method defines a 2-coloring of <span class="process-math">\(G\text{.}\)</span> Suppose that it does not define a 2-coloring. Then let <span class="process-math">\(v_a\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(v_b\)</span> be two vertices with identical colors that are connected with an edge. By the way that we colored <span class="process-math">\(G\text{,}\)</span> neither <span class="process-math">\(v_a\)</span> nor <span class="process-math">\(v_{b }\)</span> could equal <span class="process-math">\(w\text{.}\)</span>  We can now construct a circuit with an odd length in <span class="process-math">\(G\text{.}\)</span> First, we start at <span class="process-math">\(w\)</span> and follow the shortest path to <span class="process-math">\(v_a\)</span> . Then follow the edge <span class="process-math">\(\left(v_a,v_b\right)\text{,}\)</span> and finally, follow the reverse of a shortest path from <span class="process-math">\(w\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(v_b\text{.}\)</span> Since <span class="process-math">\(v_a\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(v_b\)</span> have the same color, the first and third segments of this circuit have lengths that are both odd or even, and the sum of their lengths must be even. The addition of the single edge <span class="process-math">\(\left(v_a,v_b\right)\)</span> shows us that this circuit has an odd length. This contradicts our premise.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="s-planarity-and-colorings.html#proof-27" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
