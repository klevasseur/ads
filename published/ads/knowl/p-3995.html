<div class="para">To illustrate the axiomatic level and the universal concepts, we will consider yet another kind of axiomatic system, the group. In Chapter 5 we noted that the simplest equation in matrix algebra that we are often called upon to solve is <span class="process-math">\(A X = B\text{,}\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> are known square matrices and <span class="process-math">\(X\)</span> is an unknown matrix. To solve this equation, we need the associative, identity, and inverse laws. We call the systems that have these properties groups.</div>
