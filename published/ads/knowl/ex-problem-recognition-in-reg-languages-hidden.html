<body class="ignore-math"><article class="example example-like"> <div class="para">As we mentioned at the outset of this section, finite-state machines can recognize strings in a regular language. Consider the language <span class="process-math">\(L\)</span> over <span class="process-math">\(\{a,b,c\}\)</span> that contains the strings of positive length in which each <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> is followed by <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> and each <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> is followed by <span class="process-math">\(c\text{.}\)</span> One such string is <span class="process-math">\(bccabcbc\text{.}\)</span> This language is regular. A grammar for the language would be nonterminal symbols <span class="process-math">\(\{A,B,C\}\)</span> with starting symbol <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> and production rules <span class="process-math">\(A\to bB\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(B\to cC\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(C\to aA\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(C\to bB\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(C \to cC\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(C \to c\text{.}\)</span> A finite-state machine (<a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-recognition-machine.html" title="Figure 14.3.8">Figure 14.3.8</a>) that recognizes this language can be constructed with one state for each nonterminal symbol and an additional state (Reject) that is entered if any invalid production takes place. At the end of an input tape that encodes a string in <span class="process-math">\(\{a,b,c\}^*\text{,}\)</span> we will know when the string belongs to <span class="process-math">\(L\)</span> based on the final output. If the final output is 1, the string belongs to <span class="process-math">\(L\)</span> and if it is 0, the string does not belong to <span class="process-math">\(L\text{.}\)</span> In addition, recognition can be accomplished by examining the final state of the machine. The input string belongs to the language if and only if the final state is <span class="process-math">\(C\text{.}\)</span>

<figcaption><span class="type">Figure</span><span class="space"> </span><span class="codenumber">14.3.8<span class="period">.</span></span><span class="space"> </span></figcaption></figure> <div class="para">The construction of this machine is quite easy: note how each production rule translates into an edge between states other than Reject. For example, <span class="process-math">\(C\to bB\)</span> indicates that in State <span class="process-math">\(C\text{,}\)</span> an input of <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> places the machine into State <span class="process-math">\(B\text{.}\)</span> Not all sets of production rules can be as easily translated to a finite-state machine. Another set of production rules for <span class="process-math">\(L\)</span> is <span class="process-math">\(A\to aB\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(B\to bC\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(C\to cA\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(C\to cB\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(C\to cC\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(C\to c\text{.}\)</span> Techniques for constructing finite-state machines from production rules is not our objective here. Hence we will only expect you to experiment with production rules until appropriate ones are found.</div></article></body>
