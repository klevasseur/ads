<div class="para">Almost all of the mathematics that you have done in the past was at the concrete level. As a rule, if you can give examples of a few typical elements of the domain and describe how the operations act on them, you are describing a concrete algebraic system. Two examples of concrete systems are <span class="process-math">\(B^*\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(M_{2\times 2}(\mathbb{R})\text{.}\)</span> A few others are:</div>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><div class="para">The integers with addition. Of course, addition isn’t the only standard operation that we could include. Technically, if we were to add multiplication, we would have a different system.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">The subsets of the natural numbers, with union, intersection, and complementation.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">The complex numbers with addition and multiplication.</div></li>
