<a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/corollary-zp-is-field.html" title="Corollary 16.2.6">Corollary 16.2.6</a> gives us a large number of finite fields, but we must be cautious. This  does not tell us that all finite fields are of the form <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{Z}_p\)</span> , <span class="process-math">\(p\)</span> a prime. To see this, let’s try to construct a field of order 4.</div> <div class="para logical">
<div class="para">First the field must contain the additive and multiplicative identities, 0 and 1, so, without loss of generality, we can assume that the field we are looking for is of the form <span class="process-math">\(F = \{0, 1, a, b\}\text{.}\)</span>  Since there are only two nonisomorphic groups of order 4, we have only two choices for the group table for <span class="process-math">\([F; +]\text{.}\)</span>   If the additive group is isomorphic to <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{Z}_4\)</span> then two of the nonzero elements of <span class="process-math">\(F\)</span> would not be their own additive inverse (as are 1 and 3 in <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{Z}_4\)</span>).   Let’s assume <span class="process-math">\(\beta \in F\)</span> is one of those elements and <span class="process-math">\(\beta +\beta =\gamma \neq 0\text{.}\)</span>  An isomorphism between the additive groups <span class="process-math">\(F\)</span> and  <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{Z}_4\)</span> would require that <span class="process-math">\(\gamma\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(F\)</span>  correspond with 2 in  <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{Z}_4\text{.}\)</span>  We could continue our argument and infer that <span class="process-math">\(\gamma \cdot \gamma =0\text{,}\)</span> producing a zero divisor, which we need to avoid if <span class="process-math">\(F\)</span> is to be a field.   We leave the remainder of the argument to the reader.   We can thus complete the addition table so that <span class="process-math">\([F;+]\)</span> is isomorphic to <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{Z}_2{}^2\text{:}\)</span>
</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
\begin{array}{c|cccc}
+ &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; a &amp; b \\
\hline
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; a &amp; b \\
1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; b &amp; a \\
a &amp; a &amp; b &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\
b &amp; b &amp; a &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\
\end{array}
\end{equation*}
</div>
</div> <div class="para logical">
<div class="para">Next, since 1 is the unity of <span class="process-math">\(F\text{,}\)</span> the partial multiplication table must look like:</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
\begin{array}{c|cccc}
\cdot &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; a &amp; b \\
\hline
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; a &amp; b \\
a &amp; 0 &amp; a &amp; - &amp; - \\
b &amp; 0 &amp; b &amp; - &amp; - \\
\end{array}
\end{equation*}
</div>
</div> <div class="para logical">
<div class="para">Hence, to complete the table, we have only four entries to find, and, since <span class="process-math">\(F\)</span> must be commutative, this reduces our task to filling in three entries. Next, each nonzero element of <span class="process-math">\(F\)</span> must have a unique multiplicative inverse. The inverse of <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> must be either <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> itself or <span class="process-math">\(b\text{.}\)</span> If <span class="process-math">\(a^{-1} = a\text{,}\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\(b^{-1}=b\text{.}\)</span> (Why?) But  <span class="process-math">\(a^{-1} = a \Rightarrow  a \cdot  a = 1\text{.}\)</span> And if <span class="process-math">\(a \cdot  a = 1\text{,}\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\(a \cdot  b\)</span> is equal to <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(b\text{.}\)</span>  In either case, by the cancellation law, we obtain <span class="process-math">\(a = 1\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(b = 1\text{,}\)</span> which is impossible. Therefore we are forced to conclude that <span class="process-math">\(a^{-1} = b\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b^{-1} = a\text{.}\)</span> To determine the final two products of the table, simply note that, <span class="process-math">\(a \cdot  a \neq  a\)</span> because the equation <span class="process-math">\(x^2=x\)</span> has only two solutions, 0 and 1 in any field. We also know that <span class="process-math">\(a\cdot a\)</span> cannot be 1 because <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> doesn’t invert itself and cannot be 0 because <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> can’t be a zero divisor. This leaves us with one possible conclusion, that  <span class="process-math">\(a \cdot  a = b\)</span> and similarly <span class="process-math">\(b \cdot  b = a\text{.}\)</span>  Hence, our multiplication table for <span class="process-math">\(F\)</span> is:</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
\begin{array}{c|cccc}
\cdot &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; a &amp; b \\
\hline
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; a &amp; b \\
a &amp; 0 &amp; a &amp; b &amp; 1 \\
b &amp; 0 &amp; b &amp; 1 &amp; a \\
\end{array}
\end{equation*}
</div>
</div> <div class="para">We leave it to the reader to verify that <span class="process-math">\([F; +, \cdot ]\text{,}\)</span> as described above, is a field. Hence, we have produced a field of order 4. This construction would be difficult to repeat for larger fields.  In section 16.4 we will introduce a different approach to constructing fields that will be far more efficient.</div></article></body>
