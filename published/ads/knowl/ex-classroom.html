<div class="para">Let <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> be the set of students who are sitting in a classroom,  let <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> be the set of seats in the classroom, and let <span class="process-math">\(s\)</span> be the function which maps each student into the chair he or she is sitting in. When is <span class="process-math">\(s\)</span> one to one? When is it onto? Under normal circumstances, <span class="process-math">\(s\)</span>  would always be injective since no two different students would be in the same seat.  In order for <span class="process-math">\(s\)</span> to be surjective, we need all seats to be used, so <span class="process-math">\(s\)</span>  is a surjection if the classroom is filled to capacity.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="s-properties-of-functions.html#ex-classroom" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
