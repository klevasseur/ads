<div class="para">Surprisingly, equality is also an antisymmetric relation on <span class="process-math">\(A\text{.}\)</span> This is due to the fact that the condition that defines the antisymmetry property, <span class="process-math">\(a = b\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(a \neq  b\text{,}\)</span> is a contradiction. Remember, a conditional proposition is always true when the condition is false. So a relation can be both symmetric and antisymmetric on a set! Again recall that these terms are <em class="emphasis">not</em> negatives of one other. That said, there are very few important relations other than equality that are both symmetric and antisymmetric.</div>
