<div class="para">If we apply additional elementary row operations to this matrix, it will only become more complicated. In particular, we cannot get a one in the third row, third column.

<div class="para">Any real numbers will satisfy the last equation. However, the first equation can be rewritten as <span class="process-math">\(x_1 =1-\frac{16 }{11}x_3\text{,}\)</span> which describes the coordinate <span class="process-math">\(x_1\)</span> in terms of <span class="process-math">\(x_3\)</span> . Similarly, the second equation gives <span class="process-math">\(x_2\)</span> in terms of <span class="process-math">\(x_3\)</span> . A convenient way of listing the solutions of this system is to use set notation. If we call the solution set of the system <span class="process-math">\(S\text{,}\)</span> then</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
S = \left\{\left(1-\frac{16}{11}x_3, -\frac{1}{11}x_3, x_3\right) \mid x_3\in \mathbb{R}\right\}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
</div> <div class="para">What this means is that if we wanted to list all solutions, we would replace <span class="process-math">\(x_3\)</span> by all possible numbers. Clearly, there is an infinite number of solutions, two of which are <span class="process-math">\((1, 0, 0)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\((-15, -1, 11)\text{,}\)</span> when <span class="process-math">\(x_3\)</span> takes on the values 0 and 11, respectively.</div> <div class="para">A Word Of Caution: Frequently we may can get “different-looking” answers to the same problem when a system has an infinite number of solutions. Assume the solutions set in this example is reported to be <span class="process-math">\(A = \left\{\left(1+16x_2, x_2, -11x_3\right) \mid x_3\in \mathbb{R}\right\}\text{.}\)</span> Certainly the result described by <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> looks different from that described by <span class="process-math">\(A\text{.}\)</span> To see whether they indeed describe the same set, we wish to determine whether every solution produced in <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> can be generated in <span class="process-math">\(A\text{.}\)</span> For example, the solution generated by <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> when <span class="process-math">\(x_3=11\)</span> is <span class="process-math">\((-15, -1, 11)\text{.}\)</span> The same triple can be produced by <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> by taking <span class="process-math">\(x_2= -1\text{.}\)</span> We must prove that every solution described in <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> is described in <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> and, conversely, that every solution described in <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> is described in <span class="process-math">\(S\text{.}\)</span> (See Exercise 6 of this section.)</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="s-systems-linear-equations.html#ex-system-infinite-solutions" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
