<div class="para">Most operations such as addition of numbers are introduced as binary operations. That is, we are taught that two numbers may be added together to give us a single number. Before long, we run into situations where more than two numbers are to be added. For example, if four numbers, <span class="process-math">\(a_1\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(a_2\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(a_3\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(a_4\)</span> are to be added, their sum may be written down in several ways, such as<span class="process-math">\(\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(((a_1+a_2)+a_3)+a_4\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(\left(a_1+a_2\right)+\left(a_3+a_4\right)\text{.}\)</span> In the first expression, the first two numbers are added, the result is added to the third number, and that result is added to the fourth number. In the second expression the first two numbers and the last two numbers are added and the results of these additions are added. Of course, we know that the final results will be the same. This is due to the fact that addition of numbers is an associative operation. For such operations, there is no need to describe how more than two objects will be operated on. A sum of numbers such as <span class="process-math">\(a_1+a_2+a_3+a_4\)</span> is called a series and is often written <span class="process-math">\(\sum_{k=1}^4 a_k\)</span> in what is called <em class="emphasis">summation notation</em>.</div>
