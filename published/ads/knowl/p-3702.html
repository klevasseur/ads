<div class="para">A graph of  Atlantis University  (<a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-atlantis-10.html" title="Figure 10.2.1">Figure 10.2.1</a>) shows that there are four campuses in the system. A new secure communications system is being installed and the objective is to allow for communication between any two campuses; to achieve this objective, the university must buy direct lines between certain pairs of campuses. Let <span class="process-math">\(G\)</span> be the graph with a vertex for each campus and an edge for each direct line. Total communication is equivalent to <span class="process-math">\(G\)</span> being a connected graph. This is due to the fact that two campuses can communicate over any number of lines. To minimize costs, the university wants to buy a minimum number of lines.</div>
