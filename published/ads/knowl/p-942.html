<div class="para">Assume your instructor told you “If you receive a grade of 95 or better in the final examination, then you will receive an A in this course.” Your instructor has made a promise to you. If you fulfill his condition, you expect the conclusion (getting an A) to be forthcoming. Suppose your graded final has been returned to you. Has your instructor told the truth or is your instructor guilty of a falsehood?</div>
