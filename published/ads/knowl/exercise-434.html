<div class="para">Suppose that information on buildings is arranged in records with five fields: the name of the building, its location, its owner, its height, and its floor space. The location and owner fields are records that include all of the information that you would expect, such as street, city, and state, together with the owner’s name (first, middle, last) in the owner field. Draw a rooted tree to describe this type of record</div>
