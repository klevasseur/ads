The “Start” vertex is called the initial vertex of the path, while the “End” is called the final, or terminal, vertex. Suppose that the problem is solved after two attempts; then the path that was taken is <span class="process-math">\(\text{Start}, R, A, Q, L, A, Q, \text{End}\text{.}\)</span> An alternate path description would be to list the edges that were used: <span class="process-math">\(1, 2, 3, \text{No}, 4, 3, \text{Yes}\text{.}\)</span> This second method of describing a path has the advantage of being applicable for multigraphs. On the graph in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-multigraph-ex1.html" title="Figure 9.1.13">Figure 9.1.13</a>, the vertex list <span class="process-math">\(1,2,3,4,3\)</span> does not clearly describe a path between 1 and 3, but <span class="process-math">\(e_1,e_4, e_6, e_7\)</span> is unambiguous.</div></article></body>
