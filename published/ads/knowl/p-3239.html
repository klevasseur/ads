<div class="para">Let <span class="process-math">\(v\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(w\)</span> be vertices of a directed graph. Vertex <span class="process-math">\(v\)</span> is  connected to vertex <span class="process-math">\(w\)</span> if there is a path from <span class="process-math">\(v\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(w\text{.}\)</span> Two vertices are  strongly connected if they are connected in both directions to one another. A  graph is connected if, for each pair of distinct vertices, <span class="process-math">\(v\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(w\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(v\)</span> is connected to <span class="process-math">\(w\)</span>  or <span class="process-math">\(w\)</span> is connected to <span class="process-math">\(v\text{.}\)</span> A  graph is strongly connected if every pair of its vertices is strongly connected. For an undirected graph, in which edges can be used in either direction, the notions of strongly connected and connected are the same.</div>
