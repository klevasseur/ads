<div class="para">The efficiency of any search algorithm such as the binary search relies on fact that the search list is sorted according to a key value and that the search is based on the key value. There are several methods for sorting a list. One example is the bubble sort. You might be familiar with this one since it is a popular “first sorting algorithm.” A time analysis of the algorithm shows that if <span class="process-math">\(B(n)\)</span> is the worst-case time needed to complete the bubble sort on <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> items, then <span class="process-math">\(B(n) =(n-1) + B(n-1)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(B(1) = 0\text{.}\)</span> The solution of this relation is a quadratic function <span class="process-math">\(B(n) =\frac{1}{2}\left(n^2-n\right)\text{.}\)</span> The growth rate of a quadratic function such as this one is controlled by its squared term. Any other terms are dwarfed by it as <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> gets large. For the bubble sort, this means that if we double the size of the list that we are to sort, <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> changes to <span class="process-math">\(2n\)</span> and so <span class="process-math">\(n^2\)</span> becomes <span class="process-math">\(4n^2\)</span> . Therefore, the time needed to do a bubble sort is quadrupled. One alternative to bubble sort is the merge sort. Here is a simple version of this algorithm for sorting <span class="process-math">\(F=\{r(1), r(2), \ldots , r(n)\}\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(n \geq  1\text{.}\)</span> If <span class="process-math">\(n
= 1\text{,}\)</span> the list is sorted trivially. If <span class="process-math">\(n\geq  2\)</span> then:</div>
