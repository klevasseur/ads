<div class="para">Suppose you intend to use a binary search algorithm (see <a href="s-faces-of-recursion.html#ss-recursive-searching" class="internal" title="Subsection 8.1.3: Recursive Searching - The Binary Search">Subsection 8.1.3</a>) on lists of zero or more sorted items, and that the items are stored in an array, so that you have easy access to each item. A natural question to ask is “How much time will it take to complete the search?” When a question like this is asked, the time we refer to is often the so-called worst-case time. That is, if we were to search through <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> items, what is the longest amount of time that we will need to complete the search? In order to make an analysis such as this independent of the computer to be used, time is measured by counting the number of steps that are executed. Each step (or sequence of steps) is assigned an absolute time, or weight; therefore, our answer will not be in seconds, but in absolute time units. If the steps in two different algorithms are assigned weights that are consistent, then analyses of the algorithms can be used to compare their relative efficiencies. There are two major steps that must be executed in a call of the binary search algorithm:</div>
