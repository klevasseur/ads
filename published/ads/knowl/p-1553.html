<div class="para">It’s easy to comment on the response, “I cannot do proofs.”  Have you tried? As elementary school students we may have been in awe of anyone who could handle algebraic expressions, especially complicated ones. We learned by trying and applying ourselves. Maybe we cannot solve all problems in algebra or calculus, but we are comfortable enough with these subjects to know that we can solve many and can express ourselves intelligently in these areas. The same remarks hold true for proofs.</div>
