<div class="para">Before giving an algorithm for solving finite order linear relations, we will examine recurrence relations that arise from certain closed form expressions. The closed form expressions are selected so that we will obtain finite order linear relations from them. This approach may seem a bit contrived, but if you were to write down a few simple algebraic expressions, chances are that most of them would be similar to the ones we are about to examine.</div>
