<div class="para">Induction: Assume that the number of permutations on a set with <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> elements, <span class="process-math">\(n\geq 1\text{,}\)</span> is <span class="process-math">\(n\text{!.}\)</span> Furthermore, assume that <span class="process-math">\(|A|=\)</span><span class="process-math">\(\text{  }n+1\)</span> and that <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> contains an element called <span class="process-math">\(\sigma\text{.}\)</span> Let <span class="process-math">\(A'=A-\{\sigma\}\text{.}\)</span> We can reduce the definition of a permutation, <span class="process-math">\(f\text{,}\)</span> on <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> to two steps. First, we select any one of the <span class="process-math">\(n\text{!}\)</span> permutations on <span class="process-math">\(A'\text{.}\)</span> (Note the use of the induction hypothesis.) Call it <span class="process-math">\(g\text{.}\)</span> This permutation almost completely defines a permutation on <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> that we will call  <span class="process-math">\(f\text{.}\)</span>  For all <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(A'\text{,}\)</span> we start by defining <span class="process-math">\(f(a)\)</span> to be <span class="process-math">\(g(a)\text{.}\)</span> We may be making some adjustments, but define it that way for now. Next, we select the image of <span class="process-math">\(\sigma\text{,}\)</span> which can be done <span class="process-math">\(n+1\)</span> different ways, allowing for any value in <span class="process-math">\(A\text{.}\)</span> To keep our function bijective, we must adjust <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> as follows: If we select <span class="process-math">\(f(\sigma)=y \neq \sigma\text{,}\)</span> then we must find the element, <span class="process-math">\(z\text{,}\)</span> of <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(g(z)=y\text{,}\)</span> and redefine the image  of <span class="process-math">\(z\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(f(z)=\sigma\text{.}\)</span> If we had selected <span class="process-math">\(f(\sigma)=\sigma\text{,}\)</span> then there is  no adjustment needed. By the rule of products, the number of ways that we can define <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is <span class="process-math">\(n!(n+1)=(n+1)!\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\square\)</span>
