<div class="para">Suppose you open a savings account that pays an annual interest rate of <span class="process-math">\(8\%\text{.}\)</span> In addition, suppose you decide to deposit one dollar when you open the account, and you intend to double your deposit each year. Let <span class="process-math">\(B(k)\)</span> be your balance after <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> years. <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> can be described by the relation <span class="process-math">\(B(k) = 1.08 B(k - 1) + 2^k\text{,}\)</span> with <span class="process-math">\(S(0) = 1\text{.}\)</span> If, instead of doubling the deposit each year, you deposited a constant amount, <span class="process-math">\(q\text{,}\)</span> the <span class="process-math">\(2^k\)</span> term would be replaced with <span class="process-math">\(q\text{.}\)</span>  A sequence of regular deposits such as this is called a simple annuity.</div>
