<div class="para">Since it is customary to put a precedence on multiplication/divisions, <span class="process-math">\(X\)</span> is evaluated as <span class="process-math">\(((a*b) -(c/d)) + e\text{.}\)</span> Consecutive multiplication/divisions or addition/subtractions are evaluated from left to right. We can analyze <span class="process-math">\(X\)</span> further by noting that it is the sum of two simpler expressions <span class="process-math">\((a*b) - (c/d)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(e\text{.}\)</span> The first of these expressions can be broken down further into the difference of the expressions <span class="process-math">\(a*b\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(c/d\text{.}\)</span> When we decompose any expression into <span class="process-math">\((\textrm{left expression})\textrm{operation} (\textrm{right expression})\text{,}\)</span> the expression tree of that expression is the binary tree whose root contains the operation and whose left and right subtrees are the trees of the left and right expressions, respectively. Additionally, a simple variable or a number has an expression tree that is a single vertex containing the variable or number.
