<div class="para">Our proof consists of verifying that if the three properties above are true, then all the axioms of a group are true for <span class="process-math">\([H ; *]\text{.}\)</span> By Condition (a), <span class="process-math">\(*\)</span> can be considered an operation on <span class="process-math">\(H\text{.}\)</span> The associative, identity, and inverse properties are the axioms that are needed. The identity and inverse properties are true by conditions (b) and (c), respectively, leaving only the associative property. Since, <span class="process-math">\([G; *]\)</span> is a group, <span class="process-math">\(a * (b * c) = (a * b) * c\)</span> for all <span class="process-math">\(a, b, c \in  G\text{.}\)</span> Certainly, if this equation is true for all choices of three elements from <span class="process-math">\(G\text{,}\)</span> it will be true for all choices of three elements from <span class="process-math">\(H\text{,}\)</span> since <span class="process-math">\(H\)</span> is a subset of <span class="process-math">\(G\text{.}\)</span>
