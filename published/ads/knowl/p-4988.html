<div class="para">Consider the partial ordering “divides” on <span class="process-math">\(L = \{1, 3, 5, 7, 15, 21, 35, 105\}\text{.}\)</span> Then <span class="process-math">\((L, \mid)\)</span> is a poset. To determine the least upper bound of 3 and 7, we look for all <span class="process-math">\(u  \in  L\text{,}\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(3|u\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(7|u\text{.}\)</span> Certainly, both <span class="process-math">\(u  = 21\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(u  = 105\)</span> satisfy these conditions and no other element of <span class="process-math">\(L\)</span> does. Next, since <span class="process-math">\(21|105\text{,}\)</span>  <span class="process-math">\(21\)</span> is the least upper bound of 3 and 7. Similarly, the  least upper bound of 3 and 5 is 15. The greatest element of <span class="process-math">\(L\)</span> is 105 since <span class="process-math">\(a|105\)</span> for all <span class="process-math">\(a \in  L\text{.}\)</span> To find the greatest lower bound of 15 and 35, we first consider all elements <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> of <span class="process-math">\(L\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(g \mid 15\text{.}\)</span>  They are 1, 3, 5, and 15.  The elements for which  <span class="process-math">\(g \mid 35\)</span> are 1, 5, 7, and 35. From these two lists, we see that <span class="process-math">\(\ell = 5\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\ell = 1\)</span> satisfy the required conditions. But since <span class="process-math">\(1|5\text{,}\)</span>  the greatest lower bound is 5. The least element of <span class="process-math">\(L\)</span> is 1 since <span class="process-math">\(1|a\)</span> for all <span class="process-math">\(a \in  L\text{.}\)</span>
