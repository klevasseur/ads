<div class="para">Our second example might seem strange, but we include it to illustrate a point. The algebraic system <span class="process-math">\(\left[B^*;+\right]\)</span> is a special case of <span class="process-math">\([M;*]\text{.}\)</span>  Most of us are much more comfortable with <span class="process-math">\(B^*\)</span> than with <span class="process-math">\(M\text{.}\)</span>  No doubt, the reason is that the elements in <span class="process-math">\(B^*\)</span> are more concrete.  We know what they look like and exactly how they are combined. The description of <span class="process-math">\(M\)</span> is so vague that we don’t even know what the elements are, much less how they are combined. Why would anyone want to study <span class="process-math">\(M\text{?}\)</span> The reason is related to this question: What theorems are of interest in an algebraic system? Answering this question is one of our main objectives in this chapter.  Certain properties of algebraic systems are called algebraic properties, and any theorem that says something about the algebraic properties of a system would be of interest. The ability to identify what is algebraic and what isn’t is one of the skills that you should learn from this chapter.</div>
