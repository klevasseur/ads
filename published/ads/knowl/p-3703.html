<div class="para">The solutions to this problem are all trees. Any graph that satisfies the requirements of the university must be connected, and if a cycle does exist, any line in the cycle can be deleted, reducing the cost. Each of the sixteen trees that can be drawn to connect the vertices North, South, East, and West (see <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/exercise-trees.html" title="Exercise 10.1.3.1">Exercise 10.1.3.1</a>) solves the problem as it is stated. Note that in each case, three direct lines must be purchased. There are two considerations that can help reduce the number of solutions that would be considered.</div>
