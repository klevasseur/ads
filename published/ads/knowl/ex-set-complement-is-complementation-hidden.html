<div class="para">In Chapter 1, we defined the complement of a subset of any universe.   This turns out to be a concrete example of the general concept we have just defined, but we will reason through why this is the case here.  Let <span class="process-math">\(L = \mathcal{P}(A)\text{,}\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(A = \{a, b, c\}\text{.}\)</span> Then <span class="process-math">\([L; \cup  , \cap ]\)</span> is a bounded lattice with <span class="process-math">\(0 = \emptyset\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(1 = A\text{.}\)</span> To find the complement, if it exists, of <span class="process-math">\(B = \{a, b\} \in  L\text{,}\)</span> for example, we want <span class="process-math">\(D\)</span> such that</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
\begin{array}{c}
\{a,b\} \cap D = \emptyset\\ 
and\\
\{a,b\} \cup  D = A\\
\end{array}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">It’s not too difficult to see that  <span class="process-math">\(D = \{c\}\text{,}\)</span> since we need to include <span class="process-math">\(c\)</span> to make the first condition true and can’t include <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> if the second condition is to be true.  Of course this is precisely how we defined <span class="process-math">\(A^c\)</span> in Chapter 1.  Since it can be shown that each element of <span class="process-math">\(L\)</span> has a complement (see Exercise 1), <span class="process-math">\([L; \cup  , \cap ]\)</span> is a complemented lattice. Note that if <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> is any set and <span class="process-math">\(L = \mathcal{P}(A)\text{,}\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\([L; \cup  , \cap ]\)</span> is a complemented lattice where the complement of <span class="process-math">\(B \in  L\)</span> is <span class="process-math">\(B ^c = A - B\text{.}\)</span>
