<body class="ignore-math"><article class="example example-like"><div class="para">Let <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{Z}^*\)</span> be the set of nonzero integers. One of the most basic equivalence relations in mathematics is the relation <span class="process-math">\(q\)</span> on <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{Z}\times \mathbb{Z}^*\)</span> defined by <span class="process-math">\((a, b) q(c, d)\)</span> if and only if <span class="process-math">\(a d = b c\text{.}\)</span> We will leave it to the reader to, verify that <span class="process-math">\(q\)</span> is indeed an equivalence relation. Be aware that since the elements of <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{Z}\times \mathbb{Z}^*\)</span> are ordered pairs, proving symmetry involves four numbers and transitivity involves six numbers. Two ordered pairs, <span class="process-math">\((a, b)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\((c, d)\text{,}\)</span> are related if the fractions <span class="process-math">\(\frac{a}{b}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\frac{c}{d}\)</span> are numerically equal.</div> <div class="para">Reflecting on these comments on fractions, we see that any fraction is a member of a set of equivalent fractions that can be exchanged for one another when doing arithmetic.  This is an instance of an important property of all equivalence relations that motivates the following definition.</div></article></body>
