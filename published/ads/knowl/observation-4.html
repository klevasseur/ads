The quantity <span class="process-math">\(\frac{\left\lceil \log _2 (2n)\right\rceil

Certainly, there are many graphs with eight vertices such that the optimal and closest neighbor circuits are the same. What is left unstated in this theorem is whether there are graphs for which the quantities are equal. If there are such graphs, we say that the upper bound is  sharp.</div> <div class="para">The value of <span class="process-math">\(\frac{C_{cn}}{C_{opt}}\)</span> in Example <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/ex-one-way-street.html" title="Example 9.5.8: The One-way Street">Example 9.5.8</a> is 1.6, which is greater than <span class="process-math">\(\frac{\lceil \log _2 (2\cdot 4)\rceil}{2} = 1.5\text{;}\)</span> however, the weight function in this example does not satisfy the conditions of the theorem.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="s-graph-optimization.html#observation-4" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
