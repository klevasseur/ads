<div class="para">Proof Strategy. Most of this theorem can be proven by proving the following chain of implications: <span class="process-math">\((1) \Rightarrow  (2)\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\((2) \Rightarrow  (3)\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\((3)\Rightarrow (4)\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\((4) \Rightarrow (1)\text{.}\)</span> Once these implications have been demonstrated, the transitive closure of <span class="process-math">\(\Rightarrow\)</span> on <span class="process-math">\({1, 2, 3, 4}\)</span> establishes the equivalence of the first four conditions. The proof that Statement 5 is equivalent to the first four can be done by induction, which we will leave to the reader.</div> <div class="para">
<span class="process-math">\((1) \Rightarrow  (2)\)</span> (Indirect). Assume that <span class="process-math">\(G\)</span> is a tree and that there exists a pair of vertices between which there is either no path or there are at least two distinct paths. Both of these possibilities contradict the premise that <span class="process-math">\(G\)</span> is a tree. If no path exists, <span class="process-math">\(G\)</span> is disconnected, and if two paths exist, a cycle can be obtained by <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/theorem-tree-conditions.html" title="Theorem 10.1.11: Equivalent Conditions for a Graph to be a Tree">Theorem 10.1.11</a>.</div> <div class="para">
<span class="process-math">\((2) \Rightarrow  (3)\text{.}\)</span> We now use Statement 2 as a premise. Since each pair of vertices in <span class="process-math">\(V\)</span> are connected by exactly one path, <span class="process-math">\(G\)</span> is connected. Now if we select any edge <span class="process-math">\(e\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(E\text{,}\)</span> it connects two vertices, <span class="process-math">\(v_1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(v_2\text{.}\)</span> By (2), there is no simple path connecting <span class="process-math">\(v_1\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(v_2\)</span> other than <span class="process-math">\(e\text{.}\)</span> Therefore, no path at all can exist between <span class="process-math">\(v_1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(v_2\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\((V, E - \{e\})\text{.}\)</span> Hence <span class="process-math">\((V, E - \{e\})\)</span> is disconnected.</div> <div class="para">
<span class="process-math">\((3)\Rightarrow (4)\text{.}\)</span> Now we will assume that Statement 3 is true. We must show that <span class="process-math">\(G\)</span> has no cycles and that adding an edge to <span class="process-math">\(G\)</span> creates a cycle. We will use an indirect proof for this part. Since (4) is a conjunction, by DeMorgan’s Law its negation is a disjunction and we must consider two cases. First, suppose that <span class="process-math">\(G\)</span> has a cycle. Then the deletion of any edge in the cycle keeps the graph connected, which contradicts (3). The second case is that the addition of an edge to <span class="process-math">\(G\)</span> does not create a cycle. Then there are two distinct paths between the vertices that the new edge connects. By <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/lemma-two-paths.html" title="Lemma 10.1.10">Lemma 10.1.10</a>, a cycle can then be created, which is a contradiction.</div> <div class="para">
<span class="process-math">\((4) \Rightarrow (1)\)</span> Assume that <span class="process-math">\(G\)</span> contains no cycles and that the addition of an edge creates a cycle. All that we need to prove to verify that <span class="process-math">\(G\)</span> is a tree is that <span class="process-math">\(G\)</span> is connected. If it is not connected, then select any two vertices that are not connected. If we add an edge to connect them, the fact that a cycle is created implies that a second path between the two vertices can be found which is in the original graph, which is a contradiction.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="s-what-is-a-tree.html#proof-29" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
