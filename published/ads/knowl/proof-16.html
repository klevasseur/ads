<div class="para">(<span class="process-math">\(\Rightarrow\)</span>)  In this half of the proof, assume that <span class="process-math">\(f^{-1}\)</span> exists and we must prove that <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is one-to-one and onto. To do so, it is convenient for us to use the relation notation, where <span class="process-math">\(f(s)=t\)</span> is equivalent to <span class="process-math">\((s,t)\in f\text{.}\)</span> To prove that <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is one-to-one, assume that <span class="process-math">\(f(a)=f(b) = c\text{.}\)</span> Alternatively, that means <span class="process-math">\((a, c)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\((b, c)\)</span> are elements of <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> . We must show that <span class="process-math">\(a =b\text{.}\)</span> Since <span class="process-math">\((a, b), (c, b) \in \text{  }f\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\((c, a)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\((c,b)\)</span> are in <span class="process-math">\(f^{-1}\text{.}\)</span> By the fact that <span class="process-math">\(f^{-1}\)</span> is a function and <span class="process-math">\(c\)</span> cannot have two images, <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> must be equal, so <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is one-to-one.</div> <div class="para">Next, to prove that <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is onto, observe that for <span class="process-math">\(f^{-1}\)</span> to be a function, it must use all of its domain, namely A. Let <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> be any element of <span class="process-math">\(A\text{.}\)</span> Then b has an image under <span class="process-math">\(f^{-1}\)</span> , <span class="process-math">\(f^{-1}(b)\text{.}\)</span> Another way of writing this is <span class="process-math">\(\left(b,f^{-1}(b)\right)\in
f^{-1}\text{,}\)</span> By the definition of the inverse, this is equivalent to <span class="process-math">\(\left(f^{-1}(b), b\right) \in  f\text{.}\)</span> Hence, <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> is in the range of <span class="process-math">\(f\text{.}\)</span> Since <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> was chosen arbitrarily, this shows that the range of <span class="process-math">\(f \)</span> must be all of <span class="process-math">\(A\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">(<span class="process-math">\(\Leftarrow\)</span> ) Assume <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is one-to-one and onto and we are to prove <span class="process-math">\(f^{-1}\)</span> exists. We leave this half of the proof to the reader. <span class="process-math">\(\square\)</span>
