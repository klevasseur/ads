<div class="para logical">
<div class="para">
<span class="process-math">\(A_5\text{,}\)</span> a group in its own right with 60 elements, has many proper subgroups, but none are normal. Although this could be done by brute force, the number of elements in the group would make the process tedious.  A far more elegant way to approach the verification of this statement is to use the following fact about the cycle structure of permutations.    If <span class="process-math">\(f\in S_n\)</span> is a permutation with a certain cycle structure,  <span class="process-math">\(\sigma _1\sigma _2\cdots \sigma _k\text{,}\)</span> where the length of <span class="process-math">\(\sigma _i\)</span> is <span class="process-math">\(\ell_i\text{,}\)</span> then for any <span class="process-math">\(g\in S_n\text{,}\)</span>   <span class="process-math">\(g^{-1}\circ
f\circ g\text{,}\)</span> which is the conjugate of <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> by <span class="process-math">\(g\text{,}\)</span>  will have a cycle structure with exactly the same cycle lengths.   For example if we take <span class="process-math">\(f=(1,2,3,4)(5,6)(7,8,9)\in S_9\)</span> and conjugate by <span class="process-math">\(g=(1,3,5,7,9)\text{,}\)</span>

<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
g^{-1}\circ f\circ g &amp; =(1,9,7,5,3)\circ (1,2,3,4)(5,6)(7,8,9)\circ (1,3,5,7,9)\\
&amp; = (1,4,9,2)(3,6)(5,8,7)\\
\end{split}
\end{equation*}
</div>
</div> <div class="para">Notice that the condition for normality of a subgroup <span class="process-math">\(H\)</span> of <span class="process-math">\(G\)</span> is that the conjugate of any element of <span class="process-math">\(H\)</span> by an element of <span class="process-math">\(G\)</span> must be remain in <span class="process-math">\(H\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">To verify that <span class="process-math">\(A_5\)</span> has no proper normal subgroups, you can start by cataloging the different cycle structures that occur in <span class="process-math">\(A_5\)</span> and how many elements have those structures.   Then consider what happens when you conjugate these different cycle structures with elements of <span class="process-math">\(A_5\text{.}\)</span> An outline of the process is in the exercises.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="s-normal-subgroups-homomorphisms.html#a5-is-simple" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
