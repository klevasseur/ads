<li><div class="para">In discussing planarity, we need only consider simple undirected graphs with no self-loops. All other graphs can be treated as such since all of the edges that relate any two vertices can be considered as one “package” that clearly can be drawn in a plane.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Can you think of a graph that is not planar? How would you prove that it isn’t planar? Proving the nonexistence of something is usually more difficult than proving its existence. This case is no exception. Intuitively, we would expect that sparse graphs would be planar and dense graphs would be nonplanar. <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/theorem-edge-bound.html" title="Theorem 9.6.10: A Bound on Edges of a Planar Graph">Theorem 9.6.10</a> will verify that dense graphs are indeed nonplanar.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">The topic of planarity is a result of trying to restrict a graph to two dimensions. Is there an analogous topic for three dimensions? What graphs can be drawn in one dimension?</div></li>
