<div class="para">One application of the Gray code was discussed in the Introduction to this book.  Another application is in statistics. In a statistical analysis, there is often a variable that depends on several factors, but exactly which factors are significant may not be obvious. For each subset of factors, there would be certain quantities to be calculated. One such quantity is the multiple correlation coefficient for a subset. If the correlation coefficient for a given subset, <span class="process-math">\(A\text{,}\)</span> is known, then the value for any subset that is obtained by either deleting or adding an element to <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> can be obtained quickly. To calculate the correlation coefficient for each set, we simply travel along <span class="process-math">\(G_n\text{,}\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> is the number of factors being studied. The first vertex will always be the string of 0’s, which represents the empty set. For each vertex that you visit, the set that it corresponds to contains the <span class="process-math">\(k^{\text{th}}\)</span> factor if the <span class="process-math">\(k^{\text{th}}\)</span> character is a 1.</div>
