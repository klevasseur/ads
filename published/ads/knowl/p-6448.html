<div class="para">All programming languages allow for looping.  A common form of loop is one in which a series of instructions are executed for each value of some index variable, commonly for values between two integers.  Python allows a bit more generality by having structures called “iterators” over which looping can be done.   An iterator can be as simple as a list, such as <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">[0,1,2,3]</code>, but also can be a power set of a finite set, as we see below, or the keys in a dictionary, which is described in the next section.</div>
