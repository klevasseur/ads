<body class="ignore-math"><article class="hiddenproof"><div class="para">Case 1. Given the alphabet <span class="process-math">\(B=\{0,1\}\text{,}\)</span> we can define a bijection from the positive integers into <span class="process-math">\(B^*\text{.}\)</span> Each positive integer has a binary expansion <span class="process-math">\(d_kd_{k-1}\cdots d_1d_0\text{,}\)</span> where each <span class="process-math">\(d_j\)</span> is 0 or 1 and <span class="process-math">\(d_k=1\text{.}\)</span> If <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> has such a binary expansion, then <span class="process-math">\(2^k \leq n\leq 2^{k+1}\text{.}\)</span> We define <span class="process-math">\(f:\mathbb{P}\to B^*\)</span> by <span class="process-math">\(f(n)=f\left(d_kd_{k-1}\cdots  d_1d_0\right)=d_{k-1}\cdots d_1d_0,\)</span>  where  <span class="process-math">\(f(1)=\lambda\text{.}\)</span> Every one of the <span class="process-math">\(2^k\)</span> strings of length <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> are the images of exactly one of the integers between <span class="process-math">\(2^k\textrm{ and } 2^{k+1}-1.\)</span> From its definition, <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is clearly a bijection; therefore, <span class="process-math">\(B^*\)</span> is countable.</div> <div class="para">Case 2: <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> is Finite. We will describe how this case is handled with an example first and then give the general proof. If <span class="process-math">\(A=\{a,b,c,d,e\}\text{,}\)</span> then we can code the letters in <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> into strings from <span class="process-math">\(B^3\text{.}\)</span> One of the coding schemes (there are many) is <span class="process-math">\(a\leftrightarrow 000, b\leftrightarrow
001, c\leftrightarrow 010, d\leftrightarrow 011, \textrm{ and } e\leftrightarrow 100\text{.}\)</span> Now every string in <span class="process-math">\(A^*\)</span> corresponds to a different string in <span class="process-math">\(B^*\text{;}\)</span> for example, <span class="process-math">\(ace\text{.}\)</span>  would correspond with <span class="process-math">\(000010100\text{.}\)</span> The cardinality of <span class="process-math">\(A^*\)</span> is equal to the cardinality of the set of strings that can be obtained from this encoding system. The possible coded strings must be countable, since they are a subset of a countable set, <span class="process-math">\(B^*\text{.}\)</span> Therefore, <span class="process-math">\(A^*\)</span> is countable.</div> <div class="para">If <span class="process-math">\(\lvert A\rvert =m\text{,}\)</span> then the letters in <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> can be coded using a set of fixed-length strings from <span class="process-math">\(B^*\text{.}\)</span> If <span class="process-math">\(2^{k-1} &lt; m \leq 2^k\text{,}\)</span> then there are at least as many strings of length <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(B^k\)</span> as there are letters in <span class="process-math">\(A\text{.}\)</span> Now we can associate each letter in <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> with with a different element of <span class="process-math">\(B^k\text{.}\)</span> Then any string in <span class="process-math">\(A^*\text{.}\)</span>  corresponds to a string in <span class="process-math">\(B^*\text{.}\)</span>  By the same reasoning as in the example above, <span class="process-math">\(A^*\)</span> is countable.</div> <div class="para">Case 3: <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> is Countably Infinite. We will leave this case as an exercise.</div></article></body>
