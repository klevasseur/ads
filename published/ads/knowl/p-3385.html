<div class="para">Is there a way to coat the sectors on the back of the dial so that each of the eight patterns corresponding to the numbers 0 to 7 appears once, and so that between any two adjacent sectors there is only one switch that will have a questionable setting? What we are describing here is a Hamiltonian circuit of the <span class="process-math">\(3\)</span>-cube (<a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-intro-3-cube.html" title="Figure 9.4.21">Figure 9.4.21</a>).  If one can draw a path along the edges in the 3-cube that starts at any vertex, passes through every other vertex once, and returns to the start, then that sequence of bit patterns can be used to coat the back of the dial so that between every sector there is only one questionable switch. Such a path is not difficult to find, as we will see below.</div>
