<div class="para">In this chapter we shall look more closely at some basic facts about sets. One question we could ask ourselves is: Can we manipulate sets similarly to the way we manipulated expressions in basic algebra, or to the way we manipulated propositions in logic? In basic algebra we are aware that <span class="process-math">\(a \cdot  (b + c) = a\cdot  b + a \cdot  c\)</span> for all real numbers <span class="process-math">\(a\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(b\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(c\text{.}\)</span> In logic we verified an analogue of this statement, namely, <span class="process-math">\(p
\land  ( q \lor  r) \Leftrightarrow  (p \land  q)\lor  (p \land  r))\text{,}\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(p, q, \textrm{ and } r\)</span> were arbitrary propositions. If <span class="process-math">\(A\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(B\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> are arbitrary sets, is <span class="process-math">\(A \cap  (B \cup  C) = (A \cap  B) \cup  (A \cap  C)\text{?}\)</span> How do we convince ourselves of it is truth, or discover that it is false? Let us consider some approaches to this problem, look at their pros and cons, and determine their validity.  Later in this chapter, we introduce partitions of sets and minsets.</div>
