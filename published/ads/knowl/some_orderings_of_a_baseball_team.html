<div class="para">The alphabetical ordering of the players of a baseball team is one permutation of the set of players. Other orderings of the players’ names might be done by batting average, age, or height. The information that determines the ordering is called the key. We would expect that each key would give a different permutation of the names. If there are twenty-five players on the team, there are <span class="process-math">\(25 \cdot 24 \cdot 23 \cdot \cdots  \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1\)</span> different permutations of the players.</div> <div class="para">This number of permutations is huge. In fact it is 15511210043330985984000000, but writing it like this isn’t all that instructive, while leaving it as a product as we originally had makes it easier to see where the number comes from.  We just need to find a more compact way of writing these products.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="s-permutations.html#some_orderings_of_a_baseball_team" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
