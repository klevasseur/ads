<div class="para">The term set is intuitively understood by most people to mean a collection of objects that are called elements (of the set). This concept is the starting point on which we will build more complex ideas, much as in geometry where the concepts of point and line are left undefined. Because a set is such a simple notion, you may be surprised to learn that it is one of the most difficult concepts for mathematicians to define to their own liking. For example, the description above is not a proper definition because it requires the definition of a collection. (How would you define “collection”?) Even deeper problems arise when you consider the possibility that a set could contain itself. Although these problems are of real concern to some mathematicians, they will not be of any concern to us. Our first concern will be how to describe a set; that is, how do we most conveniently describe a set and the elements that are in it? If we are going to discuss a set for any length of time, we usually give it a name in the form of a capital letter (or occasionally some other symbol). In discussing set <span class="process-math">\(A\text{,}\)</span> if <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> is an element of <span class="process-math">\(A\text{,}\)</span> then we will write <span class="process-math">\(x \in  A\text{.}\)</span> On the other hand, if <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> is not an element of <span class="process-math">\(A\text{,}\)</span> we write <span class="process-math">\(x \notin  A\text{.}\)</span> The most convenient way of describing the elements of a set will vary depending on the specific set.</div>
