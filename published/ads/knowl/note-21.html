<div class="para logical"><ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><div class="para">On notation. If two or more consecutive factors in a direct product are identical, it is common to combine them using exponential notation. For example, <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{Z} \times  \mathbb{Z} \times  \mathbb{R}\)</span> can be written <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{Z}^2 \times  \mathbb{R}\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{R} \times  \mathbb{R}
\times  \mathbb{R} \times  \mathbb{R}\)</span> can be written <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{R}^4\text{.}\)</span> This is purely a notational convenience; no exponentiation is really taking place.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">We call the operations in a direct product <dfn class="terminology">componentwise operations</dfn>, and they are indeed operations on <span class="process-math">\(V\text{.}\)</span>  If two <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span>-tuples, <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b\text{,}\)</span> are selected from <span class="process-math">\(V\text{,}\)</span> the first components of <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(a_1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b_1\text{,}\)</span> are operated on with <span class="process-math">\(*_1\)</span> to obtain <span class="process-math">\(a_1*_1b_1\text{,}\)</span> the first component of <span class="process-math">\(a * b\text{.}\)</span> Note that since <span class="process-math">\(*_1\)</span> is an operation on <span class="process-math">\(V_1\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(a_1*_1b_1\)</span> is an element of <span class="process-math">\(V_1\text{.}\)</span> Similarly, all other components of <span class="process-math">\(a * b\text{,}\)</span> as they are defined, belong to their proper sets.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">One significant fact about componentwise operations is that the components of the result can all be computed at the same time (concurrently). The time required to compute in a direct product can be reduced to a length of time that is not much longer than the maximum amount of time needed to compute in the factors.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">A direct product of algebraic systems is not always an algebraic system of the same type as its factors. This is due to the fact that certain axioms that are true for the factors may not be true for the set of <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span>-tuples. This situation does not occur with groups however. You will find that whenever a new type of algebraic system is introduced, call it type <span class="process-math">\(T\text{,}\)</span> one of the first theorems that is usually proven, if possible, is that the direct product of two or more systems of type <span class="process-math">\(T\)</span> is a system of type <span class="process-math">\(T\text{.}\)</span>
