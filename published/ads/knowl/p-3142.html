<div class="para">If <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> are two vertices of a graph, then a <dfn class="terminology">path</dfn> between <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> describes a motion from <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> along edges of the graph. Vertex <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> is called the initial vertex of the path and <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> is called the terminal vertex. A path between <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> can always be described by its  edge list, the list of edges that were used: <span class="process-math">\(\left(e_1, e_2,
\ldots , e_n\right)\text{,}\)</span> where: (1) the initial vertex of <span class="process-math">\(e_1\)</span> is <span class="process-math">\(x\text{;}\)</span> (2) the terminal vertex of <span class="process-math">\(e_i\)</span> is the initial vertex of <span class="process-math">\(e_{i+1}\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(i = 1, 2, \ldots , n - 1\text{;}\)</span> and (3) the terminal vertex of <span class="process-math">\(e_n\)</span> is <span class="process-math">\(y\text{.}\)</span> The number of edges in the edge list is the <dfn class="terminology">path length</dfn>. A path on a simple graph can also be described by a vertex list. A path of length <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> will have a list of <span class="process-math">\(n + 1\)</span> vertices <span class="process-math">\(v_0=x\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(v_1\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(v_2,\ldots ,v_n=y\text{,}\)</span> where, for <span class="process-math">\(k = 0,1,2,\ldots , n-1\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\left(v_k,v_{k+1}\right)\)</span> is an edge on the graph. A <dfn class="terminology">circuit</dfn> is a path that terminates at its initial vertex.</div>
