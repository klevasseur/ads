<div class="para">In reality, such lists exist occasionally and have appeared in newspapers from time to time. Of course they really don’t prove anything since each team that defeated MSU in our example above can produce a similar, shorter chain of results. Since college football records are readily available, the coach could have found this list by trial and error. All that he needed to start with was that his team won at least one game. Since ESU lost one game, there was some hope of producing the chain.</div>
