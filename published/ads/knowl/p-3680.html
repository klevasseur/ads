<span class="process-math">\((3)\Rightarrow (4)\text{.}\)</span> Now we will assume that Statement 3 is true. We must show that <span class="process-math">\(G\)</span> has no cycles and that adding an edge to <span class="process-math">\(G\)</span> creates a cycle. We will use an indirect proof for this part. Since (4) is a conjunction, by DeMorgan’s Law its negation is a disjunction and we must consider two cases. First, suppose that <span class="process-math">\(G\)</span> has a cycle. Then the deletion of any edge in the cycle keeps the graph connected, which contradicts (3). The second case is that the addition of an edge to <span class="process-math">\(G\)</span> does not create a cycle. Then there are two distinct paths between the vertices that the new edge connects. By <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/lemma-two-paths.html" title="Lemma 10.1.10">Lemma 10.1.10</a>, a cycle can then be created, which is a contradiction.</div>
