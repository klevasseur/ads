<em class="emphasis">Tips on Reading Multiply-Quantified Propositions.</em> It is understandable that you would find propositions such as <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> difficult to read. The trick to deciphering these expressions is to “peel” one quantifier off the proposition just as you would peel off the layers of an onion (but quantifiers shouldn’t make you cry!). Since the outermost quantifier in <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> is universal, <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> says that <span class="process-math">\(z(a) : (\exists  b)_{\mathbb{R}^+}(a b = 1)\)</span> is true for each value that <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> can take on. Now take the time to select a value for <span class="process-math">\(a\text{,}\)</span> like 6. For the value that we selected, we get <span class="process-math">\(z(6) : (\exists b)_{\mathbb{R}^+}(6b = 1)\text{,}\)</span> which is obviously true since <span class="process-math">\(6b = 1\)</span> has a solution in the positive real numbers. We will get that same truth value no matter which positive real number we choose for <span class="process-math">\(a\text{;}\)</span> therefore, <span class="process-math">\(z(a)\)</span> is a tautology over <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{R}^+\)</span> and we are justified in saying that <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> is true. The key to understanding propositions like <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> on your own is to experiment with actual values for the outermost variables as we did above.</div>
