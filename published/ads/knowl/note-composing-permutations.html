<div class="para logical">
<div class="para">We will now consider the composition of permutations written in cyclic form by an example. Suppose that <span class="process-math">\(f
= (1,8, 3, 7)(4, 6)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(g = (1, 5, 6)(8, 3, 7, 4)\)</span> are elements of <span class="process-math">\(S_8\text{.}\)</span> To calculate <span class="process-math">\(f\circ g\text{,}\)</span> we start with simple concatenation:</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="./knowl/equation-cycle-composition-1.html">
\begin{gather}
f \circ g = (1,8, 3, 7)(4, 6)(1,5,6)(8, 3, 7,4)\tag{15.3.1}
\end{gather}
</div>
<div class="para">Although this is a valid expression for <span class="process-math">\(f \circ g\text{,}\)</span> our goal is to express the composition as a product of disjoint cycles as <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> were individually written. We will start by determining the cycle that contains 1.  When combining any number of cycles, they are always read from right to left, as with all functions. The first cycle  in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/equation-cycle-composition-1.html" title="Equation 15.3.1">(15.3.1)</a> does not contain 1; thus we move on to the second. The image of 1 under that cycle is 5. Now we move on to the next cycle, looking for 5, which doesn’t appear. The fourth cycle does not contain a 5 either; so <span class="process-math">\(f\circ g(1) = 5\text{.}\)</span>
</div>
</div> <div class="para">At this point, we would have written “<span class="process-math">\(f \circ g = (1,5 \)</span>” on paper. We repeat the steps to determine <span class="process-math">\(f\circ g(5)\text{.}\)</span> This time the second cycle of <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/equation-cycle-composition-1.html" title="Equation 15.3.1">(15.3.1)</a> moves 5 to 6 and then the third cycle moves 6 to 4. Therefore, <span class="process-math">\(f\circ g(5) = 4\text{.}\)</span> We continue until the cycle (1, 5, 4, 3) is completed by determining that <span class="process-math">\(f\circ g(3) = 1\text{.}\)</span> The process is  then repeated starting with any number that does not appear in the cycle(s) that have already been completed.</div> <div class="para">The final result for our example is <span class="process-math">\(f \circ g = (1, 5, 4, 3)(6, 8, 7)\text{.}\)</span> Since <span class="process-math">\(f(2) = 2\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(g(2) = 2\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(f\circ g(2) = 2\)</span> and we need not include the one-cycle (2) in the final result, although it can be included.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="s-permutation-groups.html#note-composing-permutations" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
