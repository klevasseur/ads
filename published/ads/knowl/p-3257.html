<div class="para">(Indirect): Suppose <span class="process-math">\(u\)</span> is connected to <span class="process-math">\(w\text{,}\)</span> but the shortest path from <span class="process-math">\(u\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(w\)</span> has length <span class="process-math">\(m\text{,}\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(m&gt;n\text{.}\)</span> A vertex list for a path of length <span class="process-math">\(m\)</span> will have <span class="process-math">\(m + 1\)</span> vertices. This path can be represented as <span class="process-math">\(\left(v_0,v_1,\ldots, v_m\right)\text{,}\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(v_0=u\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(v_m= w\text{.}\)</span> Note that since there are only <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> vertices in the graph and <span class="process-math">\(m\)</span> vertices are listed in the path after <span class="process-math">\(v_0\text{,}\)</span> we can apply the pigeonhole principle and be assured that there must be some duplication in the last <span class="process-math">\(m\)</span> vertices of the vertex list, which represents a circuit in the path. This means that our path of minimum length can be reduced, which is a contradiction.</div>
