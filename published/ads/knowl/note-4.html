</h4> <div class="para">When a quantity, such as a savings account balance, is increased by some fixed percent, it is most easily computed with a multiplier. In the case of an <span class="process-math">\(8\%\)</span> increase, the multiplier is 1.08 because any original amount <span class="process-math">\(A\text{,}\)</span> has <span class="process-math">\(0.08A\)</span> added to it, so that the new balance is <span class="process-math">\(A+0.08A = (1+0.08)A = 1.08 A\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">Another example is that if the interest rate is <span class="process-math">\(3.5\%\text{,}\)</span> the multiplier would be 1.035. This presumes that the interest is applied at the end of year for <span class="process-math">\(3.5\%\)</span> annual interest, often called <dfn class="terminology">simple interest</dfn>. If the interest is applied monthly, and we assume a simplifed case where each month has the same length, the multiplier after every month would be <span class="process-math">\(\left(1+\frac{0.035}{12}\right) \approx  1.00292\text{.}\)</span> After a year passes, this multiplier would be applied 12 times, which is the same as multiplying by <span class="process-math">\(1.00292^{12}\approx 1.03557\text{.}\)</span> That increase from 1.035 to 1.03557 is the effect of <dfn class="terminology">compound interest</dfn>.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="s-recurrence-relations.html#note-4" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
