<div class="para">To recognize <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span> from <span class="process-math">\(G(R;z)\text{,}\)</span> we must do a partial fractions decomposition:</div>

<div class="para">For example, <span class="process-math">\(R(6) = 3^7 - 2^7= 2187 - 128 = 2059\text{.}\)</span> Naturally, this equals the sum that we get from <span class="process-math">\((S*T)(6)\text{.}\)</span> To put this number in perspective, the total number of strings of length 6 with no restrictions is <span class="process-math">\(5^6=15625\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\frac{2059}{15625}\approx 0.131776\text{.}\)</span> Therefore approximately 13 percent of the strings of length 6 satisfy the conditions of the problem.</div>
