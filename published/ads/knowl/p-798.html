<div class="para">We see that the whole universal set is naturally partitioned into subsets that are labeled by the numbers 1 through 8, and the set <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span>  is  partitioned into subsets labeled 1 through 7. The region labeled 8 represents all students who are not junior CS majors.  Note also that students in the subsets labeled 2, 3, and 4 are double counted, and those in the subset labeled 1 are triple counted. To adjust, we must subtract the numbers in regions 2, 3 and 4.  This can be done by subtracting the numbers in the intersections of each pair of sets.  However, the individuals in region 1 will have been removed three times, just as they had been originally added three times.  Therefore, we must finally add their number back in.</div>
