<li><div class="para">The Minimum Matching Problem: Given an undirected weighted graph, <span class="process-math">\((K, E, w)\text{,}\)</span> with an even number of vertices, pair up the vertices so that each pair is connected by an edge and the sum of these edges is as small as possible. A unit square version of this problem has been studied extensively. See <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/biblio-sopowit-1983.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 40: The Traveling Salesman Problem and Minimum Matching in the Unit Square">[40]</a> for details on what is known about this version of the problem.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">  The Graph Center Problem: Given a connected, undirected, weighted graph, find a vertex (called a center) in the graph with the property that the distance from the center to every other vertex is as small as possible. “As small as possible” is  normally interpreted  as minimizing the maximum distance from the center to a vertex.</div></li>
