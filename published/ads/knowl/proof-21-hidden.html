<body class="ignore-math"><article class="hiddenproof"><div class="para">It can be proven by induction that the number of vertices in an undirected graph that have an odd degree must be even. We will leave the proof of this fact to the reader as an exercise. The necessity of having either zero or two vertices of odd degree is clear from the proof of the Koenigsberg case of this theorem. Therefore, we will concentrate on proving that this condition is sufficient to ensure that a graph has an Eulerian path. Let <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> be the number of vertices with odd degree.</div> <div class="para">Phase 1. If <span class="process-math">\(k = 0\text{,}\)</span> start at any vertex, <span class="process-math">\(v_0\text{,}\)</span> and travel along any path, not using any edge twice. Since each vertex has an even degree, this path can always be continued past each vertex that you reach except <span class="process-math">\(v_0\text{.}\)</span> The result is a circuit that includes <span class="process-math">\(v_0\text{.}\)</span> If <span class="process-math">\(k =2\text{,}\)</span> let <span class="process-math">\(v_0\)</span> be either one of the vertices of odd degree. Trace any path starting at <span class="process-math">\(v_0\)</span> using up edges until you can go no further, as in the <span class="process-math">\(k = 0\)</span> case. This time, the path that you obtain must end at the other vertex of odd degree that we will call <span class="process-math">\(v_1\text{.}\)</span>  At the end of Phase 1, we have an initial path that may or may not be Eulerian. If it is not Eulerian, Phase 2 can be repeated until all of the edges have been used.  Since the number of unused edges is decreased in any use of Phase 2, an Eulerian path must be obtained in a finite number of steps.</div> <div class="para">Phase 2. As we enter this phase, we have constructed a path that uses a proper subset of the edges in our graph. We will refer to this path as the current path. Let <span class="process-math">\(V\)</span> be the vertices of our graph, <span class="process-math">\(E\)</span> the edges, and <span class="process-math">\(E_u\)</span> the edges that have been used in the current path. Consider the graph <span class="process-math">\(G' = \left(V, E - E_u\right)\text{.}\)</span>  Note that every vertex in <span class="process-math">\(G'\)</span> has an even degree. Select any edge, <span class="process-math">\(e\text{,}\)</span> from <span class="process-math">\(G'.\)</span> Let <span class="process-math">\(v_a\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(v_b\)</span> be the vertices that <span class="process-math">\(e\)</span> connects. Trace a new path starting at <span class="process-math">\(v_a\)</span> whose first edge is <span class="process-math">\(e\text{.}\)</span> We can be sure that at least one vertex of the new path is also in the current path since <span class="process-math">\((V, E)\)</span> is connected. Starting at <span class="process-math">\(v_a\text{,}\)</span> there exists a path in <span class="process-math">\((V, E)\)</span> to any vertex in the current path. At some point along this path, which we can consider the start of the new path, we will have intersected the current path. Since the degree of each vertex in <span class="process-math">\(G'\)</span> is even, any path that we start at <span class="process-math">\(v_a\)</span> can be continued until it is a circuit. Now, we simply augment the current path with this circuit. As we travel along the current path, the first time that we intersect the new path, we travel along it (see <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-path-augmentation.html" title="Figure 9.4.8">Figure 9.4.8</a>). Once we complete the circuit that is the new path, we resume the traversal of the current path.</div> <figure class="figure figure-like"><div class="image-box" style="width: 100%; margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%;"><img src="external/images/fig-path-augmentation.png" class="contained" alt="Path Augmentation Plan"></div>
