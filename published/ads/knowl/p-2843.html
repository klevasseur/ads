<div class="para">Suppose that <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> is a small positive number. Consider the recurrence relation <span class="process-math">\(B(k) - 2B(k - 1) + \left(1 - C ^2\right)B(k - 2)
= C^2\text{,}\)</span> with initial conditions <span class="process-math">\(B(0) = 1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(B(1) = 1\text{.}\)</span> If <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> is small enough, we might consider approximating the relation by replacing <span class="process-math">\(1 - C^2\)</span> with 1 and <span class="process-math">\(C^2\)</span> with 0. Solve the original relation and its approximation. Let <span class="process-math">\(B_a\)</span> a be the solution of the approximation. Compare closed form expressions for <span class="process-math">\(B(k)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(B_a(k)\text{.}\)</span> Their forms are very different because the characteristic roots of the original relation were close together and the approximation resulted in one double characteristic root. If characteristic roots of a relation are relatively far apart, this problem will not occur. For example, compare the general solutions of <span class="process-math">\(S(k) + 1.001S(k - 1) - 2.004002 S(k - 2) = 0.0001\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(S_a(k) + S_a(k - 1) - 2S_a(k - 2) = 0\text{.}\)</span>
