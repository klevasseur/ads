<li><div class="para">(Concrete) We can verify that <span class="process-math">\(2\mathbb{Z} \leq  \mathbb{Z}\text{,}\)</span> as stated in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/ex-subsystems.html" title="Example 11.5.2: Examples of Subsystems">Example 11.5.2</a>. Whenever you want to discuss a subset, you must find some convenient way of describing its elements. An element of <span class="process-math">\(2\mathbb{Z}\)</span> can be described as 2 times an integer; that is, <span class="process-math">\(a \in  2\mathbb{Z}\)</span> is equivalent to <span class="process-math">\((\exists k)_{\mathbb{Z}}(a = 2k)\text{.}\)</span> Now we can verify that the three conditions of <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/th-subgroup-conditions.html" title="Theorem 11.5.3: Subgroup Conditions">Theorem 11.5.3</a> are true for 2<span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{Z}\text{.}\)</span> First, if <span class="process-math">\(a, b \in  2\mathbb{Z}\text{,}\)</span> then there exist <span class="process-math">\(j, k \in  \mathbb{Z}\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(a = 2j\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b = 2k\text{.}\)</span>   A common error is to write something like  <span class="process-math">\(a=2j\)</span>  and <span class="process-math">\(b=2j\text{.}\)</span>  This would mean that <span class="process-math">\(a=b\text{,}\)</span> which is not necessarily true.   That is why two different variables are needed to describe <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b\text{.}\)</span>  Returning to our proof, we can add <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b\text{:}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(a + b = 2j + 2k = 2(j + k)\text{.}\)</span> Since <span class="process-math">\(j + k\)</span> is an integer, <span class="process-math">\(a + b\)</span> is an element of <span class="process-math">\(2\mathbb{Z}\text{.}\)</span>   Second, the identity, <span class="process-math">\(0\text{,}\)</span> belongs to 2<span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{Z}\)</span> (<span class="process-math">\(0 = 2(0)\)</span>).  Finally, if <span class="process-math">\(a \in  2\mathbb{Z}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(a = 2k, -a = -(2k) = 2(-k)\text{,}\)</span> and  <span class="process-math">\(-k\in \mathbb{Z}\text{,}\)</span>  therefore, <span class="process-math">\(-a \in  2\mathbb{Z}\text{.}\)</span> By <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/th-subgroup-conditions.html" title="Theorem 11.5.3: Subgroup Conditions">Theorem 11.5.3</a>, <span class="process-math">\(2\mathbb{Z} \leq  \mathbb{Z}\text{.}\)</span> How would this argument change if you were asked to prove that <span class="process-math">\(3\mathbb{Z} \leq  \mathbb{Z}\text{?}\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(n \mathbb{Z} \leq  \mathbb{Z}, n \geq  2\text{?}\)</span>

<li><div class="para">(Concrete) We can prove that <span class="process-math">\(H = \{0, 3, 6, 9\}\)</span> is a subgroup of <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{Z}_{12}\text{.}\)</span> First, for each ordered pair <span class="process-math">\((a, b) \in  H \times
H\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(a +_{12} b\)</span> is in <span class="process-math">\(H\text{.}\)</span> This can be checked without too much trouble since <span class="process-math">\(\left| H \times H\right| = 16\text{.}\)</span> Thus we can conclude that <span class="process-math">\(H\)</span> is closed under <span class="process-math">\(+_{12}\text{.}\)</span> Second, <span class="process-math">\(0\in H\text{.}\)</span> Third, <span class="process-math">\(-0 = 0\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(-3 = 9\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(-6 = 6\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(-9 = 3\text{.}\)</span> Therefore, the inverse of each element of <span class="process-math">\(H\)</span> is in <span class="process-math">\(H\text{.}\)</span>
</div></li>
<li><div class="para">(Axiomatic) If <span class="process-math">\(H\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(K\)</span> are both subgroups of a group <span class="process-math">\(G\text{,}\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\(H \cap  K\)</span> is a subgroup of <span class="process-math">\(G\text{.}\)</span> To justify this statement, we have no concrete information to work with, only the facts that <span class="process-math">\(H \leq  G\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(K \leq G\text{.}\)</span> Our proof that <span class="process-math">\(H \cap  K \leq  G\)</span> reflects this and is an exercise in applying the definitions of intersection and subgroup, (i) If <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> are elements of <span class="process-math">\(H \cap K\text{,}\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> both belong to <span class="process-math">\(H\text{,}\)</span> and since <span class="process-math">\(H \leq  G\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(a * b\)</span> must be an element of <span class="process-math">\(H\text{.}\)</span> Similarly, <span class="process-math">\(a * b \in  K\text{;}\)</span> therefore, <span class="process-math">\(a * b \in  H \cap  K\text{.}\)</span> (ii) The identity of <span class="process-math">\(G\)</span> must belong to both <span class="process-math">\(H\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(K\text{;}\)</span> hence it belongs to <span class="process-math">\(H \cap  K\text{.}\)</span> (iii) If <span class="process-math">\(a \in H \cap K\text{,}\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\(a \in 
H\text{,}\)</span> and since <span class="process-math">\(H \leq  G\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(a^{-1}\in  H\text{.}\)</span>  Similarly, <span class="process-math">\(a^{-1}\in K\text{.}\)</span> Hence, by the theorem,  <span class="process-math">\(H \cap  K \leq  G\text{.}\)</span> Now that this fact has been established, we can apply it to any pair of subgroups of any group. For example, since <span class="process-math">\(2\mathbb{Z}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(3\mathbb{Z}\)</span> are both subgroups of <span class="process-math">\([\mathbb{Z};+]\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(2\mathbb{Z} \cap  3\mathbb{Z}\)</span> is also a subgroup of <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{Z}\text{.}\)</span> Note that if <span class="process-math">\(a \in 2\mathbb{Z}
\cap  3\mathbb{Z}\text{,}\)</span>  <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> must have a factor of 3; that is, there exists <span class="process-math">\(k\in \mathbb{Z}\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(a = 3k\text{.}\)</span> In addition, <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> must be even, therefore <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> must be even. There exists <span class="process-math">\(j \in  \mathbb{Z}\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(k = 2j\text{,}\)</span> therefore <span class="process-math">\(a = 3(2j)= 6j\text{.}\)</span>  This shows that <span class="process-math">\(2\mathbb{Z}\cap  3\mathbb{Z}\subseteq  6\mathbb{Z}\text{.}\)</span> The opposite containment can easily be established; therefore, <span class="process-math">\(2\mathbb{Z} \cap  3\mathbb{Z}
= 6\mathbb{Z}\text{.}\)</span>
