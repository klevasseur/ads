<div class="para">The desired tour is then a path that uses each edge once and only once. Since the path can start and end at two different vertices, there are two remaining vertices that must be intermediate vertices in the path. If <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> is an intermediate vertex, then every time that you visit <span class="process-math">\(x\text{,}\)</span> you must use two of its incident edges, one to enter and one to exit. Therefore, there must be an even number of edges connecting <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> to the other vertices. Since every vertex in the Koenigsberg graph has an odd number of edges, no tour of the type that is desired is possible.</div>
