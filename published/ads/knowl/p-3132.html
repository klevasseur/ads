<div class="para">A network of computers can be described easily using a graph.  <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-undirected-1.html" title="Figure 9.1.8">Figure 9.1.8</a> describes a network of five computers, <span class="process-math">\(a\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(b\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(c\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(d\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(e\text{.}\)</span> An edge between any two vertices indicates that direct two-way communication is possible between the two computers. Note that the edges of this graph are not directed. This is due to the fact that the relation that is being displayed is symmetric (i.e., if <span class="process-math">\(X\)</span> can communicate with <span class="process-math">\(Y\text{,}\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\(Y\)</span> can communicate with <span class="process-math">\(X\)</span>). Although directed edges could be used here, it would simply clutter the graph.</div>
