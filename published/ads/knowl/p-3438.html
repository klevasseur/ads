<div class="para">Although the closest neighbor circuit is often not optimal, we may be satisfied if it is close to optimal. If <span class="process-math">\(C_{opt}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(C_{cn}\)</span> are the costs of optimal and closest neighbor circuits in a graph, then it is always the case that <span class="process-math">\(C_{opt}\leq C_{cn}\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(\frac{C_{cn}}{C_{opt}}\geq
1\text{.}\)</span> We can assess how good the closest neighbor algorithm is by determining how small the quantity <span class="process-math">\(\frac{C_{cn}}{C_{opt}}\)</span> gets. If it is always near 1, then the algorithm is good. However, if there are graphs for which it is large, then the algorithm may be discarded. Note that in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/ex-tsp-small-example.html" title="Example 9.5.6: A small example">Example 9.5.6</a>, <span class="process-math">\(\frac{C_{cn}}{C_{opt}} = \frac{29}{27}\approx 1.074\text{.}\)</span> A 7 percent increase in cost may or may not be considered significant, depending on the situation.</div>
