<div class="para">A somewhat less standard example of a boolean algebra is derived from the lattice of divisors of 30 under the relation “divides”.  If you examine the ordering diagram for this lattice, you see that it is structurally the same as the boolean algebra of subsets of a three element set.  Therefore, the join, meet and complementation operations act the same as union, intersection and set complementation.   We might conjecture that the lattice of divisors of any integer will produce a boolean algebra, but it is only the case of certain integers.   Try out a few integers to see if you can identify what is necessary to produce a boolean algebra.</div>
