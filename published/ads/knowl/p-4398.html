<div class="para">The Isomorphism: Since each system has only one operation, it is clear that union and the OR gate translate into one another. The translation between sets and bit strings is easiest to describe by showing how to construct a set from a bit string. If <span class="process-math">\(a_1a_2a_3a_4a_5\text{,}\)</span> is a bit string in System 2, the set that it translates to contains the number <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> if and only if <span class="process-math">\(a_k\)</span> equals 1. For example, <span class="process-math">\(10001\)</span> is translated to the set <span class="process-math">\(\{1, 5\}\text{,}\)</span> while the set <span class="process-math">\(\{1, 2\}\)</span> is translated to <span class="process-math">\(11000.\)</span> Now imagine that your computer is like the child who knows English and must do a Greek problem. To execute a program that has code that includes the set expression <span class="process-math">\(\{1, 2\} \cup  \{1, 5\}\text{,}\)</span> it will follow the same procedure as the child to obtain the result, as shown in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-set-calculation.html" title="Figure 11.7.6">Figure 11.7.6</a>.</div>
