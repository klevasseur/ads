</h4> <div class="para">If <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> are two vertices of a graph, then a <dfn class="terminology">path</dfn> between <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> describes a motion from <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> along edges of the graph. Vertex <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> is called the initial vertex of the path and <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> is called the terminal vertex. A path between <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> can always be described by its  edge list, the list of edges that were used: <span class="process-math">\(\left(e_1, e_2,
\ldots , e_n\right)\text{,}\)</span> where: (1) the initial vertex of <span class="process-math">\(e_1\)</span> is <span class="process-math">\(x\text{;}\)</span> (2) the terminal vertex of <span class="process-math">\(e_i\)</span> is the initial vertex of <span class="process-math">\(e_{i+1}\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(i = 1, 2, \ldots , n - 1\text{;}\)</span> and (3) the terminal vertex of <span class="process-math">\(e_n\)</span> is <span class="process-math">\(y\text{.}\)</span> The number of edges in the edge list is the <dfn class="terminology">path length</dfn>. A path on a simple graph can also be described by a vertex list. A path of length <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> will have a list of <span class="process-math">\(n + 1\)</span> vertices <span class="process-math">\(v_0=x\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(v_1\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(v_2,\ldots ,v_n=y\text{,}\)</span> where, for <span class="process-math">\(k = 0,1,2,\ldots , n-1\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\left(v_k,v_{k+1}\right)\)</span> is an edge on the graph. A <dfn class="terminology">circuit</dfn> is a path that terminates at its initial vertex.</div> <div class="para">Suppose that a path between two vertices has an edge list <span class="process-math">\((e_1, e_2 , . . . ,e_n)\text{.}\)</span> A <dfn class="terminology">subpath</dfn> of this graph is any portion of the path described by one or more consecutive edges in the edge list. For example, <span class="process-math">\((3, \textrm{No}, 4)\)</span> is a subpath of <span class="process-math">\((1,2,3, \textrm{No}, 4, 3, \text{Yes})\text{.}\)</span>  Any path is its own subpath; however, we call it an improper subpath of itself. All other nonempty subpaths are called proper subpaths.</div> <div class="para">A path or circuit is  simple if it contains no proper subpath that is a circuit. This is the same as saying that a path or circuit is simple if it does not visit any vertex more than once except for the common initial and terminal vertex in the circuit. In the problem-solving method described in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-labeled-graph-9-1.html" title="Figure 9.1.15">Figure 9.1.15</a>, the path that you take is simple only if you reach a solution on the first try.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="s-graphs-introduction.html#note-8" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
