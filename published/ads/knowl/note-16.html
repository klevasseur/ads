<div class="para">At the axiomatic and universal levels, there are often symbols that have a special meaning attached to them. In group theory, the letter <span class="process-math">\(e\)</span> is used to denote the identity element of whatever group is being discussed. A little later, we will prove that the inverse of a group element, <span class="process-math">\(a\text{,}\)</span> is unique and its inverse is usually denoted <span class="process-math">\(a^{-1}\)</span> and is read “<span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> inverse.” When a concrete group is discussed, these symbols are dropped in favor of concrete symbols. These concrete symbols may or may not be similar to the generic symbols. For example, the identity element of the group of integers is 0, and the inverse of <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> is denoted by <span class="process-math">\(-n\text{,}\)</span> the additive inverse of <span class="process-math">\(n\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">The asterisk could also be considered a generic symbol since it is used to denote operations on the axiomatic level.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="s-algebraic-systems.html#note-16" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
