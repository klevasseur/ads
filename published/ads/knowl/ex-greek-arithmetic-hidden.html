<div class="para">Imagine that you are a six-year-old child who has been reared in an English-speaking family, has moved to Greece, and has been enrolled in a Greek school. Suppose that your new teacher asks the class to do the following addition problem that has been written out in Greek.</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="./knowl/fig-greek-sum.html">
\begin{equation*}
\tau \rho \acute{\iota} \alpha \quad \sigma \upsilon \nu \quad  \tau \acute{\epsilon} \sigma \sigma \varepsilon \rho \alpha \quad \iota \sigma o \acute{\upsilon} \tau \alpha \iota \quad \_\_\_\_
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">The natural thing for you to do is to take out your Greek-English/English-Greek dictionary and translate the Greek words to English, as outlined in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-greek-sum.html" title="Figure 11.7.3">Figure 11.7.3</a> After you’ve solved the problem, you can consult the same dictionary to find the proper Greek word that the teacher wants. Although this is not the recommended method of learning a foreign language, it will surely yield the correct answer to the problem. Mathematically, we may say that the system of Greek integers with addition (<span class="process-math">\(\sigma \upsilon \nu\)</span>) is isomorphic to English integers with addition (plus). The problem of translation between natural languages is more difficult than this though, because two complete natural languages are not isomorphic, or at least the isomorphism between them is not contained in a simple dictionary.</div>
