<div class="para logical">
<div class="para">Theoretically, you can prove anything in propositional calculus with truth tables. In fact, the laws of logic stated in Section 3.4 are all theorems.  Propositional calculus is one of the few mathematical systems for which any valid sentence can be determined true or false by mechanical means. A program to write truth tables is not too difficult to write; however, what can be done theoretically is not always practical. For example,</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
a, a\to  b, b\to  c, . . . ,y\to z\Rightarrow z
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">is a theorem in propositional calculus. However, suppose that you wrote such a program and you had it write the truth table for</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
(a\land  (a\to  b)\land ( b\to  c)\land \cdots \land (y\to z))\to z
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">The truth table will have <span class="process-math">\(2^{26}\)</span> cases. At one million cases per second, it would take approximately one hour to verify the theorem.  Now if you decided to check a similar theorem,</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
p_1,p_1\to p_2,\ldots  ,p_{99}\to p_{100}\Rightarrow p_{100}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">you would really have time trouble. There would be <span class="process-math">\(2^{100} \approx 1.26765\times 10^{30}\)</span> cases to check in the truth table.  At one million cases per second it would take approximately <span class="process-math">\(1.46719\times 10^{19}\)</span> days to check all cases.  For most of the remainder of this section, we will discuss an alternate method for proving theorems in propositional calculus. It is the same method that we will use in a less formal way for proofs in other systems. Formal axiomatic methods would be too unwieldy to actually use in later sections. However, none of the theorems in later chapters would be stated if they couldn’t be proven by the axiomatic method.</div>
