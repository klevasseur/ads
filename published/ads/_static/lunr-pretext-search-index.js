  "body": "Preface  Applied Discrete Structures is designed for use in a university course in discrete mathematics spanning up to two semesters. Its original design was for computer science majors to be introduced to the mathematical topics that are useful in computer science. It can also serve the same purpose for mathematics majors, providing a first exposure to many essential topics.  We embarked on this open-source project in 2010, twenty-one years after the publication of the 2nd edition of Applied Discrete Structures for Computer Science in 1989. We had signed a contract for the second edition with Science Research Associates in 1988 but by the time the book was ready to print, SRA had been sold to MacMillan. Soon after, the rights had been passed on to Pearson Education, Inc. In 2010, the long-term future of printed textbooks was uncertain. In the meantime, textbook prices (both printed and e-books) had increased and a growing open source textbook movement had started. One of our objectives in revisiting this text is to make it available to our students in an affordable format. In its original form, the text was peer-reviewed and was adopted for use at several universities throughout the country. For this reason, we see Applied Discrete Structures as not only an inexpensive alternative, but a high quality alternative.  The current version of Applied Discrete Structures has been developed using PreTeXt , a lightweight XML application for authors of scientific articles, textbooks and monographs initiated by Rob Beezer, U. of Puget Sound. When the PreTeXt project was launched, it was the natural next step. The features of PreTeXt make it far more readable, with easy production of web, pdf and print formats.  The current computing landscape is very different from the 1980's and this accounts for the most significant changes in the text. One of the most common programming languages of the 1980's was Pascal. We used it to illustrate many of the concepts in the text. Although it isn't totally dead, Pascal is far from the mainstream of computing in the 21st century. The open source software movement was just starting in the late 1980's and in 2005, the first version of Sage (later renamed SageMath), an open-source computer algebra system, was first released. In Applied Discrete Structures we have replaced \"Pascal Notes\" with \"SageMath Notes.\"  Many of the concepts introduced in this text are illustrated using SageMath code. SageMath ( sagemath.org ) is a free, open source, software system for advanced mathematics. Sage can be used either on your own computer, a local server, or on SageMathCloud ( https:\/\/cloud.sagemath.com ).   Ken Levasseur  Lowell, MA   "

  "body": " Set Notation and Relations   The notion of a set  The term set is intuitively understood by most people to mean a collection of objects that are called elements (of the set). This concept is the starting point on which we will build more complex ideas, much as in geometry where the concepts of point and line are left undefined. Because a set is such a simple notion, you may be surprised to learn that it is one of the most difficult concepts for mathematicians to define to their own liking. For example, the description above is not a proper definition because it requires the definition of a collection. (How would you define collection ?) Even deeper problems arise when you consider the possibility that a set could contain itself. Although these problems are of real concern to some mathematicians, they will not be of any concern to us. Our first concern will be how to describe a set; that is, how do we most conveniently describe a set and the elements that are in it? If we are going to discuss a set for any length of time, we usually give it a name in the form of a capital letter (or occasionally some other symbol). In discussing set , if is an element of , then we will write . is an element of On the other hand, if is not an element of , we write . is not an element of The most convenient way of describing the elements of a set will vary depending on the specific set.  Enumeration. When the elements of a set are enumerated (or listed) it is traditional to enclose them in braces. For example, the set of binary digits is and the set of decimal digits is . The choice of a name for these sets would be arbitrary; but it would be logical to call them and , respectively. The choice of a set name is much like the choice of an identifier name in programming. Some large sets can be enumerated without actually listing all the elements. For example, the letters of the alphabet and the integers from 1 to 100 could be described as , and . The three consecutive dots are called an ellipsis. We use them when it is clear what elements are included but not listed. An ellipsis is used in two other situations. To enumerate the positive integers, we would write , indicating that the list goes on infinitely. If we want to list a more general set such as the integers between 1 and , where is some undetermined positive integer, we might write .  Standard Symbols . Sets that are frequently encountered are usually given symbols that are reserved for them alone. For example, since we will be referring to the positive integers throughout this book, we will use the symbol instead of writing . A few of the other sets of numbers that we will use frequently are:  the positive integers : the positive integers,  the natural numbers : the natural numbers,  the integers : the integers,  the rational numbers : the rational numbers  the real numbers : the real numbers  the complex numbers : the complex numbers  Caution: Some people (roughly half of the world?) call the set the natural numbers. We are not among them. We take the pythonic approach that assumes that starting with zero is more natural than starting at one.  Set-Builder Notation Set-Builder Notation . Another way of describing sets is to use set-builder notation. For example, we could define the rational numbers as . Note that in the set-builder description for the rational numbers:  indicates that a typical element of the set is a fraction.   The vertical line, , is read such that or where, and is used interchangeably with a colon.    is an abbreviated way of saying and are integers.  Commas in mathematics are read as and.    The important fact to keep in mind in set notation, or in any mathematical notation, is that it is meant to be a help, not a hindrance. We hope that notation will assist us in a more complete understanding of the collection of objects under consideration and will enable us to describe it in a concise manner. However, brevity of notation is not the aim of sets. If you prefer to write and instead of , you should do so. Also, there are frequently many different, and equally good, ways of describing sets. For example, and both describe the solution set .  A proper definition of the real numbers is beyond the scope of this text. It is sufficient to think of the real numbers as the set of points on a number line. The complex numbers can be defined using set-builder notation as , where .  In the following definition we will leave the word finite undefined.   Finite Set  A set is a finite set if it has a finite number of elements. Any set that is not finite is an infinite set.     Cardinality    The number of elements in a finite set .   Let be a finite set. The number of different elements in is called its cardinality. The cardinality of a finite set is denoted .    As we will see later, there are different infinite cardinalities. We can't make this distinction until Chapter 7, so we will restrict cardinality to finite sets for now.    Subsets   Subset     is a subset of .   Let and be sets. We say that is a subset of if and only if every element of is an element of . We write to denote the fact that is a subset of .    Some Subsets   If and , then .     If and , then and .     Set Equality  Let and be sets. We say that is equal to (notation ) if and only if every element of is an element of and conversely every element of is an element of ; that is, and .     Examples illustrating set equality   In , . Note that the ordering of the elements is unimportant.  The number of times that an element appears in an enumeration doesn't affect a set. For example, if and , then . Warning to readers of other texts: Some books introduce the concept of a multiset, in which the number of occurrences of an element matters.    A few comments are in order about the expression if and only if as used in our definitions. This expression means is equivalent to saying, or more exactly, that the word (or concept) being defined can at any time be replaced by the defining expression. Conversely, the expression that defines the word (or concept) can be replaced by the word.  Occasionally there is need to discuss the set that contains no elements, namely the empty set, which is denoted by the empty set Empty set . This set is also called the null set.  It is clear, we hope, from the definition of a subset, that given any set we have and . If is nonempty, then is called an improper subset Improper subset of . All other subsets of , including the empty set, are called proper subsets Proper subset of . The empty set is an improper subset of itself.  Not everyone is in agreement on whether the empty set is a proper subset of any set. In fact earlier editions of this book sided with those who considered the empty set an improper subset. However, we bow to the emerging consensus at this time.    Exercises   List four elements of each of the following sets:              These answers are not unique.                List all elements of the following sets:               Describe the following sets using set-builder notation.     the rational numbers that are strictly between and   the even integers                  Use set-builder notation to describe the following sets:              Let , , and . Determine which of the following statements are true. Give reasons for your answers.                  True  False  True  True  False  True  False  True   (From ) Explain why there is no set which satisfies .    One reason that we left the definition of a set vague is Russell's Paradox. Many mathematics and logic books contain an account of this paradox. Two references are and . Find one such reference and read it.   "

Frequently, when doing mathematics, we need to establish a universe or set of elements under discussion.

For example, if the universe is the integers, then is empty. If our universe is the rational numbers, then is and if the universe is the complex numbers, then is .   Universe Universe The universe, or universal set, is the set of all elements under discussion for possible membership in a set. We normally reserve the letter for a universe in general discussions.      Set Operations and their Venn Diagrams  When working with sets, as in other branches of mathematics, it is often quite useful to be able to draw a picture or diagram of the situation under consideration. A diagram of a set is called a Venn diagram. The universal set is represented by the interior of a rectangle and the sets by disks inside the rectangle.   Venn Diagram Examples   is illustrated in by shading the appropriate region.

Venn, John Euler, Leonhard Venn diagrams are named after the logician John Venn, who introduced them in a paper in 1880. In his paper, he acknowledged that they were not new. In fact he referred to them as Euler Circles, because the famous mathematician Leonhard Euler (pronounced Oy-ler) introduced them in the 1700's. Don't feel bad for Euler though. He has plenty of other things named after him, including some we see later in this book.     SageMath Note: Sets SageMath Note Sets  To work with sets in Sage, a set is an expression of the form Set( list ). By wrapping a list with Set( ) , the order of elements appearing in the list and their duplication are ignored. For example, L1 and L2 are two different lists, but notice how as sets they are considered equal:   The standard set operations are all methods and\/or functions that can act on Sage sets. You need to evaluate the following cell to use the subsequent cell.   We can test membership, asking whether 10 is in each of the sets:   The ampersand is used for the intersection of sets. Change it to the vertical bar, |, for union.   Symmetric difference and set complement are defined as methods in Sage. Here is how to compute the symmetric difference of with , followed by their differences.     Exercises  Let , , , and let the universal set be .

  "title": "Binary Representation of Positive Integers",
  "body": " Binary Representation of Positive Integers Binary Representation   Grouping by Twos  Recall that the set of positive integers, , is . Positive integers are naturally used to count things. There are many ways to count and many ways to record, or represent, the results of counting. For example, if we wanted to count five hundred twenty-three apples, we might group the apples by tens. There would be fifty-two groups of ten with three single apples left over. The fifty-two groups of ten could be put into five groups of ten tens (hundreds), with two tens left over. The five hundreds, two tens, and three units is recorded as 523. This system of counting is called the base ten positional system, or decimal system. It is quite natural for us to do grouping by tens, hundreds, thousands, since it is the method that all of us use in everyday life.  The term positional refers to the fact that each digit in the decimal representation of a number has a significance based on its position. Of course this means that rearranging digits will change the number being described. You may have learned of numeration systems in which the position of symbols does not have any significance (e.g., the ancient Egyptian system). Most of these systems are merely curiosities to us now.  The binary number system differs from the decimal number system in that units are grouped by twos, fours, eights, etc. That is, the group sizes are powers of two instead of powers of ten. For example, twenty-three can be grouped into eleven groups of two with one left over. The eleven twos can be grouped into five groups of four with one group of two left over. Continuing along the same lines, we find that twenty-three can be described as one sixteen, zero eights, one four, one two, and one one, which is abbreviated , or simply if the context is clear.    A Conversion Algorithm  The process that we used to determine the binary representation of can be described in general terms to determine the binary representation of any positive integer . A general description of a process such as this one is called an algorithm. Since this is the first algorithm in the book, we will first write it out using less formal language than usual, and then introduce some algorithmic notation. If you are unfamiliar with algorithms, we refer you to   Start with an empty list of bits.  Assign the variable the value .  While 's value is positive, continue performing the following three steps until becomes zero and then stop.   divide by 2, obtaining a quotient (often denoted ) and a remainder (denoted ).  attach to the left-hand side of the list of bits.  assign the variable the value .     An example of conversion to binary  To determine the binary representation of 41 we take the following steps:              Therefore,   The notation that we will use to describe this algorithm and all others is called pseudocode, an informal variation of the instructions that are commonly used in many computer languages. Read the following description carefully, comparing it with the informal description above. Appendix B, which contains a general discussion of the components of the algorithms in this book, should clear up any lingering questions. Anything after \/\/ are comments.   Binary Conversion Algorithm Binary Conversion Algorithm  An algorithm for determining the binary representation of a positive integer.  Input: a positive integer n.  Output: the binary representation of n in the form of a list of bits, with units bit last, twos bit next to last, etc.   k := n \/\/initialize k  L := { } \/\/initialize L to an empty list  While k > 0 do   q := k div 2 \/\/divide k by 2  r:= k mod 2  L: = prepend r to L \/\/add r to the front of L  k:= q \/\/reassign k      Here is a Sage version of the algorithm with two alterations. It outputs the binary representation as a string, and it handles all integers, not just positive ones.   Now that you've read this section, you should get this joke.

Using this fact, determine how many bits the binary representations of the following decimal numbers have without actually doing the full conversion. 2017 4000 4500  There is a bit for each power of 2 up to the largest one needed to represent an integer, and you start counting with the zeroth power. For example, 2017 is between and , and so the largest power needed is . Therefore there are bits in binary 2017.         51     Let be a positive integer with -bit binary representation: with What are the smallest and largest values that could have?    If a positive integer is a multiple of 100, we can identify this fact from its decimal representation, since it will end with two zeros. What can you say about a positive integer if its binary representation ends with two zeros? What if it ends in zeros?  A number must be a multiple of four if its binary representation ends in two zeros. If it ends in zeros, it must be a multiple of .    Can a multiple of ten be easily identified from its binary representation?    "

  "body": " Summation Notation and Generalizations Summation Notation and Generalizations   Sums  Most operations such as addition of numbers are introduced as binary operations. That is, we are taught that two numbers may be added together to give us a single number. Before long, we run into situations where more than two numbers are to be added. For example, if four numbers, , , , and are to be added, their sum may be written down in several ways, such as  or . In the first expression, the first two numbers are added, the result is added to the third number, and that result is added to the fourth number. In the second expression the first two numbers and the last two numbers are added and the results of these additions are added. Of course, we know that the final results will be the same. This is due to the fact that addition of numbers is an associative operation. For such operations, there is no need to describe how more than two objects will be operated on. A sum of numbers such as is called a series and is often written in what is called summation notation .  We first recall some basic facts about series that you probably have seen before. A more formal treatment of sequences and series is covered in Chapter 8. The purpose here is to give the reader a working knowledge of summation notation and to carry this notation through to intersection and union of sets and other mathematical operations.  A finite series is an expression such as  In the expression :   The variable is referred to as the index , or the index of summation.  The expression is the general term of the series. It defines the numbers that are being added together in the series.  The value of below the summation symbol is the initial index and the value above the summation symbol is the terminal index .  It is understood that the series is a sum of the general terms where the index start with the initial index and increases by one up to and including the terminal index.    Some finite series            More finite series  If the general terms in a series are more specific, the sum can often be simplified. For example,        .

  "body": " Basic Counting Techniques - The Rule of Products  What is Combinatorics?  One of the first concepts our parents taught us was the art of counting. We were taught to raise three fingers to indicate that we were three years old. The question of how many is a natural and frequently asked question. Combinatorics is the art of counting. It is the study of techniques that will help us to count the number of objects in a set quickly. Highly sophisticated results can be obtained with this simple concept. The following examples will illustrate that many questions concerned with counting involve the same process.  How many lunches can you have? A snack bar serves five different sandwiches and three different beverages. How many different lunches can a person order? One way of determining the number of possible lunches is by listing or enumerating all the possibilities. One systematic way of doing this is by means of a tree, as in the following figure.   Tree diagram to enumerate the number of possible lunches.   Tree diagram to enumerate the number of possible lunches. Starting at a node labeled Start, there are five branches, one for each possible sandwich that can be ordered. For each sandwich node there are three branches emanating from it, one for each possible beverage. The result is fifteen end nodes, one for each possible lunch.    Every path that begins at the position labeled START and goes to the right can be interpreted as a choice of one of the five sandwiches followed by a choice of one of the three beverages. Note that considerable work is required to arrive at the number fifteen this way; but we also get more than just a number. The result is a complete list of all possible lunches. If we need to answer a question that starts with How many . . . , enumeration would be done only as a last resort. In a later chapter we will examine more enumeration techniques.  An alternative method of solution for this example is to make the simple observation that there are five different choices for sandwiches and three different choices for beverages, so there are different lunches that can be ordered.    Counting elements in a cartesian product  Let and . From Chapter 1 we know how to list the elements in . Since the first entry of each pair can be any one of the five elements , and , and since the second can be any one of the three numbers 1, 2, and 3, it is quite clear there are different elements in .   A True-False Questionnaire A person is to complete a true-false questionnaire consisting of ten questions. How many different ways are there to answer the questionnaire? Since each question can be answered in either of two ways (true or false), and there are ten questions, there are different ways of answering the questionnaire. The reader is encouraged to visualize the tree diagram of this example, but not to draw it!   We formalize the procedures developed in the previous examples with the following rule and its extension.    The Rule Of Products   The Rule Of Products  Rule Of Products, The  Products Rule of  If two operations must be performed, and if the first operation can always be performed different ways and the second operation can always be performed different ways, then there are different ways that the two operations can be performed.   Note: It is important that does not depend on the option that is chosen in the first operation. Another way of saying this is that is independent of the first operation. If is dependent on the first operation, then the rule of products does not apply.  Reduced Lunch Possibilities Assume in , coffee is not served with a beef or chicken sandwiches. Then by inspection of we see that there are only thirteen different choices for lunch. The rule of products does not apply, since the choice of beverage depends on one's choice of a sandwich.   The rule of products can be extended to include sequences of more than two operations.   Extended Rule Of Products  Extended Rule Of Products, The  Products Extended Rule of  If operations must be performed, and the number of options for each operation is , respectively, with each independent of previous choices, then the operations can be performed different ways.   A Multiple Choice Questionnaire A questionnaire contains four questions that have two possible answers and three questions with five possible answers. Since the answer to each question is independent of the answers to the other questions, the extended rule of products applies and there are different ways to answer the questionnaire.   In Chapter 1 we introduced the power set of a set , , which is the set of all subsets of . Can we predict how many elements are in for a given finite set ? The answer is yes, and in fact if , then . The ease with which we can prove this fact demonstrates the power and usefulness of the rule of products. Do not underestimate the usefulness of simple ideas.  Power Set Cardinality Theorem Power Set Cardinality Theorem  If is a finite set, then .  Proof: Consider how we might determine any , where . For each element there are two choices, either or . Since there are elements of we have, by the rule of products, different subsets of . Therefore, .     In horse racing, to bet the daily double is to select the winners of the first two races of the day. You win only if both selections are correct. In terms of the number of horses that are entered in the first two races, how many different daily double bets could be made?  If there are horses in race 1 and horses in race 2 then there are possible daily doubles.    Professor Shortcut records his grades using only his students' first and last initials. What is the smallest class size that will definitely force Prof. S. to use a different system?  A certain shirt comes in four sizes and six colors. One also has the choice of a dragon, an alligator, or no emblem on the pocket. How many different shirts could you order?    A builder of modular homes would like to impress his potential customers with the variety of styles of his houses. For each house there are blueprints for three different living rooms, four different bedroom configurations, and two different garage styles. In addition, the outside can be finished in cedar shingles or brick. How many different houses can be designed from these plans?  The Pi Mu Epsilon mathematics honorary society of Outstanding University wishes to have a picture taken of its six officers. There will be two rows of three people. How many different way can the six officers be arranged?      An automobile dealer has several options available for each of three different packages of a particular model car: a choice of two styles of seats in three different colors, a choice of four different radios, and five different exteriors. How many choices of automobile does a customer have?  A clothing manufacturer has put out a mix-and-match collection consisting of two blouses, two pairs of pants, a skirt, and a blazer. How many outfits can you make? Did you consider that the blazer is optional? How many outfits can you make if the manufacturer adds a sweater to the collection?  If we always include the blazer in the outfit we would have 6 outfits. If we consider the blazer optional then there would be 12 outfits. When we add a sweater we have the same type of choice. Considering the sweater optional produces 24 outfits.   As a freshman, suppose you had to take two of four lab science courses, one of two literature courses, two of three math courses, and one of seven physical education courses. Disregarding possible time conflicts, how many different schedules do you have to choose from?  (a) Suppose each single character stored in a computer uses eight bits. Then each character is represented by a different sequence of eight 0's and 1's called a bit pattern. How many different bit patterns are there? (That is, how many different characters could be represented?)  (b) How many bit patterns are palindromes (the same backwards as forwards)?  (c) How many different bit patterns have an even number of 1's?    . Here we are concerned only with the first four bits, since the last four must be the same.   , you have no choice in the last bit.     Automobile license plates in Massachusetts usually consist of three digits followed by three letters. The first digit is never zero. How many different plates of this type could be made?   Let . Determine the number of different subsets of .   Let . Determine the number of proper subsets of .       In the second part we can arrive at the answer by counting all subsets and subtracting one since one of the sets (the whole set) is an improper subsets.   How many integers from 100 to 999 can be written in base ten without using the digit 7?  Consider three persons, A, B, and C, who are to be seated in a row of three chairs. Suppose A and B are identical twins. How many seating arrangements of these persons can there be   If you are a total stranger?  If you are A and B's mother?   This problem is designed to show you that different people can have different correct answers to the same problem.       How many ways can a student do a ten-question true-false exam if he or she can choose not to answer any number of questions?  Suppose you have a choice of fish, lamb, or beef for a main course, a choice of peas or carrots for a vegetable, and a choice of pie, cake, or ice cream for dessert. If you must order one item from each category, how many different dinners are possible?   Suppose you have a choice of vanilla, chocolate, or strawberry for ice cream, a choice of peanuts or walnuts for chopped nuts, and a choice of hot fudge or marshmallow for topping.

  "body": " Permutations   Ordering Things  A number of applications of the rule of products are of a specific type, and because of their frequent appearance they are given their own designation, permutations. Consider the following examples.  Ordering the elements of a set How many different ways can we order the three different elements of the set ? Since we have three choices for position one, two choices for position two, and one choice for the third position, we have, by the rule of products, different ways of ordering the three letters. We illustrate through a tree diagram.   A tree to enumerate permutations of a three element set.   A tree to enumerate permutations of a three element set.    Each of the six orderings is called a permutation of the set .   Ordering a schedule A student is taking five courses in the fall semester. How many different ways can the five courses be listed? There are different permutations of the set of courses.   In each of the above examples of the rule of products we observe that:   We are asked to order or arrange elements from a single set.  Each element is listed exactly once in each list (permutation). So if there are choices for position one in a list, there are choices for position two, choices for position three, etc.   Some orderings of a baseball team The alphabetical ordering of the players of a baseball team is one permutation of the set of players. Other orderings of the players' names might be done by batting average, age, or height. The information that determines the ordering is called the key. We would expect that each key would give a different permutation of the names. If there are twenty-five players on the team, there are different permutations of the players.  This number of permutations is huge. In fact it is 15511210043330985984000000, but writing it like this isn't all that instructive, while leaving it as a product as we originally had makes it easier to see where the number comes from. We just need to find a more compact way of writing these products.   We now develop notation that will be useful for permutation problems.  Factorial  Factorial factorial, the product of the first positive integers  If is a positive integer then factorial is the product of the first positive integers and is denoted . Additionally, we define zero factorial, , to be 1.   The first few factorials are .  Note that is 4 times , or 24, and is 5 times , or 120. In addition, note that as grows in size, grows extremely quickly. For example, . If the answer to a problem happens to be , as in the previous example, you would never be expected to write that number out completely. However, a problem with an answer of can be reduced to , or 600.  If , there are ways of permuting all elements of . We next consider the more general situation where we would like to permute elements out of a set of objects, where .  Choosing Club Officers A club of twenty-five members will hold an election for president, secretary, and treasurer in that order. Assume a person can hold only one position. How many ways are there of choosing these three officers? By the rule of products there are ways of making a selection.   Permutation Permutation An ordered arrangement of elements selected from a set of elements, , where no two elements of the arrangement are the same, is called a permutation of objects taken at a time. The total number of such permutations is denoted by .    Permutation Counting Formula Permutation Counting Formula The number of possible permutations of elements taken from a set of elements is .    Case I: If we have .  Case II: If ,then we have positions to fill using elements and   Position 1 can be filled by any one of elements  Position 2 can be filled by any one of elements     Position k can be filled by any one of elements   Hence, by the rule of products, .    It is important to note that the derivation of the permutation formula given above was done solely through the rule of products. This serves to reiterate our introductory remarks in this section that permutation problems are really rule-of-products problems. We close this section with several examples.  Another example of choosing officers  A club has eight members eligible to serve as president, vice-president, and treasurer. How many ways are there of choosing these officers?  Solution 1: Using the rule of products. There are eight possible choices for the presidency, seven for the vice-presidency, and six for the office of treasurer. By the rule of products there are ways of choosing these officers.  Solution 2: Using the permutation formula. We want the total number of permutations of eight objects taken three at a time:      Course ordering, revisited  To count the number of ways to order five courses, we can use the permutation formula. We want the number of permutations of five courses taken five at a time: .   Ordering of digits under different conditions  Consider only the digits 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.   How many three-digit numbers can be formed if no repetition of digits can occur?  How many three-digit numbers can be formed if repetition of digits is allowed?  How many three-digit numbers can be formed if only non-consecutive repetition of digits are allowed?   Solutions to (a): Solution 1: Using the rule of products. We have any one of five choices for digit one, any one of four choices for digit two, and three choices for digit three. Hence, different three-digit numbers can be formed.  Solution 2; Using the permutation formula. We want the total number of permutations of five digits taken three at a time: .  Solution to (b): The definition of permutation indicates ...no two elements in each list are the same. Hence the permutation formula cannot be used. However, the rule of products still applies. We have any one of five choices for the first digit, five choices for the second, and five for the third. So there are possible different three-digit numbers if repetition is allowed.  Solution to (c): Again, the rule of products applies here. We have any one of five choices for the first digit, but then for the next two digits we have four choices since we are not allowed to repeat the previous digit So there are possible different three-digit numbers if only non-consecutive repetitions are allowed.      If a raffle has three different prizes and there are 1,000 raffle tickets sold, how many different ways can the prizes be distributed?

How many two-digit numbers can be formed if no repetition of digits is allowed? List them.  How many two-digit numbers can be obtained if repetition is allowed?    How many eight-letter words can be formed from the 26 letters in the alphabet? Even without concerning ourselves about whether the words make sense, there are two interpretations of this problem. Answer both.  With repetition:  Without repetition:    Let be a set with . Determine       The state finals of a high school track meet involves fifteen schools.

Partition Partition A partition of set is a set of one or more nonempty subsets of : , such that every element of is in exactly one set. Symbolically,    If then    The subsets in a partition are often referred to as blocks. Note how our definition allows us to partition infinite sets, and to partition a set into an infinite number of subsets. Of course, if is finite the number of subsets can be no larger than .  Some partitions of a four element set  Let . Examples of partitions of are:          How many others are there, do you suppose?  There are 15 different partitions. The most efficient way to count them all is to classify them by the size of blocks. For example, the partition has block sizes 1, 1, and 2.    Some Integer Partitions Two examples of partitions of set of integers are   and   .   The set of subsets is not a partition because the two subsets have a nonempty intersection. A second example of a non-partition is because one of the blocks, when is empty.  One could also think of the concept of partitioning a set as a packaging problem. How can one package a carton of, say, twenty-four cans? We could use: four six-packs, three eight-packs, two twelve-packs, etc. In all cases: (a) the sum of all cans in all packs must be twenty-four, and (b) a can must be in one and only one pack.   Addition Laws  The Basic Law Of Addition: Basic Law Of Addition: If is a finite set, and if is a partition of , then    The basic law of addition can be rephrased as follows: If is a finite set where and where whenever , then   Counting All Students The number of students in a class could be determined by adding the numbers of students who are freshmen, sophomores, juniors, and seniors, and those who belong to none of these categories. However, you probably couldn't add the students by major, since some students may have double majors.  Counting Students in Disjoint Classes The sophomore computer science majors were told they must take one and only one of the following courses that are open only to them: Cryptography, Data Structures, or Javascript. The numbers in each course, respectively, for sophomore CS majors, were 75, 60, 55. How many sophomore CS majors are there? The Law of Addition applies here. There are exactly CS majors since the rosters of the three courses listed above would be a partition of the CS majors.   Counting Students in Non-disjoint Classes It was determined that all junior computer science majors take at least one of the following courses: Algorithms, Logic Design, and Compiler Construction. Assume the number in each course was 75, 60 and 55, respectively for the three courses listed. Further investigation indicated ten juniors took all three courses, twenty-five took Algorithms and Logic Design, twelve took Algorithms and Compiler Construction, and fifteen took Logic Design and Compiler Construction. How many junior C.S. majors are there?  was a simple application of the law of addition, however in this example some students are taking two or more courses, so a simple application of the law of addition would lead to double or triple counting. We rephrase information in the language of sets to describe the situation more explicitly.   = the set of all junior computer science majors   = the set of all junior computer science majors who took Algorithms   = the set of all junior computer science majors who took Logic Design   = the set of all junior computer science majors who took Compiler Construction  Since all junior CS majors must take at least one of the courses, the number we want is:   A Venn diagram is helpful to visualize the problem. In this case the universal set can stand for all students in the university.   Venn Diagram   A three set Venn Diagram to solve the Junior CS student example.     We see that the whole universal set is naturally partitioned into subsets that are labeled by the numbers 1 through 8, and the set is partitioned into subsets labeled 1 through 7. The region labeled 8 represents all students who are not junior CS majors. Note also that students in the subsets labeled 2, 3, and 4 are double counted, and those in the subset labeled 1 are triple counted. To adjust, we must subtract the numbers in regions 2, 3 and 4. This can be done by subtracting the numbers in the intersections of each pair of sets. However, the individuals in region 1 will have been removed three times, just as they had been originally added three times. Therefore, we must finally add their number back in.    The ideas used in this latest example gives rise to a basic counting technique:   Laws of Inclusion-Exclusion  Inclusion-Exclusion, Laws of   Given finite sets , then  The Two Set Inclusion-Exclusion Law:  The Three Set Inclusion-Exclusion Law:     The inclusion-exclusion laws extend to more than three sets, as will be explored in the exercises.  In this section we saw that being able to partition a set into disjoint subsets gives rise to a handy counting technique. Given a set, there are many ways to partition depending on what one would wish to accomplish. One natural partitioning of sets is apparent when one draws a Venn diagram. This particular partitioning of a set will be discussed further in Chapters 4 and 13.    Exercises  List all partitions of the set .     Which of the following collections of subsets of the plane, , are partitions?    The set of all circles in  The set of all circles in centered at the origin together with the set    A student, on an exam paper, defined the term partition the following way: Let be a set. A partition of is any set of nonempty subsets of such that each element of is in one of the subsets. Is this definition correct? Why?  No. By this definition it is possible that an element of might belong to two of the subsets.   Let and be subsets of a set . Draw a Venn diagram of this situation and shade in the subsets , , , and . Use the resulting diagram and the definition of partition to convince yourself that the subset of these four subsets that are nonempty form a partition of .   Show that is a partition of . Describe this partition using only words. The first subset is all the even integers and the second is all the odd integers. These two sets do not intersect and they cover the integers completely.    A group of 30 students were surveyed and it was found that 18 of them took Calculus and 12 took Physics. If all students took at least one course, how many took both Calculus and Physics? Illustrate using a Venn diagram.  What is the answer to the question in part (a) if five students did not take either of the two courses? Illustrate using a Venn diagram.      A survey of 90 people, 47 of them played tennis and 42 of them swam. If 17 of them participated in both activities, how many of them participated in neither? Since 17 participated in both activities, 30 of the tennis players only played tennis and 25 of the swimmers only swam. Therefore, of those who were surveyed participated in an activity and so 18 did not.   A survey of 300 people found that 60 owned an iPhone, 75 owned a Blackberry, and 30 owned an Android phone. Furthermore, 40 owned both an iPhone and a Blackberry, 12 owned both an iPhone and an Android phone, and 8 owned a Blackberry and an Android phone. Finally, 3 owned all three phones.   How many people surveyed owned none of the three phones?  How many people owned a Blackberry but not an iPhone?  How many owned a Blackberry but not an Android?     Regarding the ,  Use the two set inclusion-exclusion law to derive the three set inclusion-exclusion law. Note: A knowledge of basic set laws is needed for this exercise.  State and derive the inclusion-exclusion law for four sets.  We assume that .   The law for four sets is   Derivation:    To complete your spring schedule, you must add Calculus and Physics. At 9:30, there are three Calculus sections and two Physics sections; while at 11:30, there are two Calculus sections and three Physics sections. How many ways can you complete your schedule if your only open periods are 9:30 and 11:30?  The definition of given in Chapter 1 is awkward. If we use the definition to list elements in , we will have duplications such as , and Try to write a more precise definition of the rational numbers so that there is no duplication of elements.  Partition the set of fractions into blocks, where each block contains fractions that are numerically equivalent. Describe how you would determine whether two fractions belong to the same block. Redefine the rational numbers to be this partition. Each rational number is a set of fractions.   "

  "body": " Combinations and the Binomial Theorem   Combinations Combinations  In Section 2.1 we investigated the most basic concept in combinatorics, namely, the rule of products. It is of paramount importance to keep this fundamental rule in mind. In Section 2.2 we saw a subclass of rule-of-products problems, permutations, and we derived a formula as a computational aid to assist us. In this section we will investigate another counting formula, one that is used to count combinations, which are subsets of a certain size.  In many rule-of-products applications the ordering is important, such as the batting order of a baseball team. In other cases it is not important, as in placing coins in a vending machine or in the listing of the elements of a set. Order is important in permutations. Order is not important in combinations.  Counting Permutations How many different ways are there to permute three letters from the set ? From the there are different orderings of three letters from   Counting with No Order  How many ways can we select a set of three letters from ? Note here that we are not concerned with the order of the three letters. By trial and error, abc, abd, acd, and bcd are the only listings possible. To repeat, we were looking for all three-element subsets of the set . Order is not important in sets. The notation for choosing 3 elements from 4 is most commonly or occasionally , either of which is read 4 choose 3 or the number of combinations for four objects taken three at a time.   Binomial Coefficient  Binomial Coefficient    choose , the number of element subsets of an element set.    Let and be nonnegative integers. The binomial coefficient represents the number of combinations of objects taken at a time, and is read choose .    We would now like to investigate the relationship between permutation and combination problems in order to derive a formula for  Let us reconsider the . There are different orderings for each of the three-element subsets. The table below lists each subset of and all permutations of each subset on the same line. .  Hence,  We generalize this result in the following theorem:  Binomial Coefficient Formula Binomial Coefficient Formula   If and are nonnegative integers with , then the number -element subsets of an element set is equal to .  Proof 1: There are ways of ordering the elements of any element set. Therefore, .  Proof 2: To construct a permutation of objects from a set of elements, we can first choose one of the subsets of objects and second, choose one of the permutations of those objects. By the rule of products, and solving for we get the desired formula.   Flipping Coins Assume an evenly balanced coin is tossed five times. In how many ways can three heads be obtained? This is a combination problem, because the order in which the heads appear does not matter. We can think of this as a situation involving sets by considering the set of flips of the coin, 1 through 5, in which heads comes up. The number of ways to get three heads is .  Counting five ordered flips two ways  We determine the total number of ordered ways a fair coin can land if tossed five consecutive times. The five tosses can produce any one of the following mutually exclusive, disjoint events: 5 heads, 4 heads, 3 heads, 2 heads, 1 head, or 0 heads. For example, by the previous example, there are sequences in which three heads appear. Counting the other possibilities in the same way, by the law of addition we have: ways to observe the five flips.  Of course, we could also have applied the extended rule of products, and since there are two possible outcomes for each of the five tosses, we have ways.  You might think that counting something two ways is a waste of time but solving a problem two different ways often is instructive and leads to valuable insights. In this case, it suggests a general formula for the sum . In the case of , we get so it is reasonable to expect that the general sum is , and it is. A logical argument to prove the general statment simply involves generalizing the previous example to coin flips.  A Committee of Five A committee usually starts as an unstructured set of people selected from a larger membership. Therefore, a committee can be thought of as a combination. If a club of 25 members has a five-member social committee, there are different possible social committees. If any structure or restriction is placed on the way the social committee is to be selected, the number of possible committees will probably change. For example, if the club has a rule that the treasurer must be on the social committee, then the number of possibilities is reduced to .  If we further require that a chairperson other than the treasurer be selected for the social committee, we have different possible social committees. The choice of the four non-treasurers accounts for the factor while the need to choose a chairperson accounts for the 4.  Binomial Coefficients - Extreme Cases By simply applying the definition of a as a number of subsets we see that there is way of choosing a combination of zero elements from a set of . In addition, we see that there is way of choosing a combination of elements from a set of .  We could compute these values using the formula we have developed, but no arithmetic is really needed here. Other properties of binomial coefficients that can be derived using the subset definition will be seen in the exercises     The Binomial Theorem  The binomial theorem gives us a formula for expanding , where is a nonnegative integer. The coefficients of this expansion are precisely the binomial coefficients that we have used to count combinations. Using high school algebra we can expand the expression for integers from 0 to 5:    In the expansion of we note that the coefficient of the third term is , and that of the sixth term is . We can rewrite the expansion as .  In summary, in the expansion of we note:   The first term is and the last term is .  With each successive term, exponents of decrease by 1 as those of increase by 1. For any term the sum of the exponents is .  The coefficient of is .  The triangular array of binomial coefficients is called Pascal's triangle after the seventeenth-century French mathematician Blaise Pascal. Note that each number in the triangle other than the 1's at the ends of each row is the sum of the two numbers to the right and left of it in the row above.  The Binomial Theorem Binomial Theorem, The  If , and and are numbers, then .   This theorem will be proven using a logical procedure called mathematical induction, which will be introduced in Chapter 3.   Identifying a term in an expansion Find the third term in the expansion of . The third term, when , is .   A Binomial Expansion Expand . If we replace and in the Binomial Theorem with and , respectively, we get .    SageMath Note SageMath Note bridge hands  A bridge hand is a 13 element subset of a standard 52 card deck. The order in which the cards come to the player doesn't matter. From the point of view of a single player, the number of possible bridge hands is , which can be easily computed with .   In bridge, the location of a hand in relation to the dealer has some bearing on the game. An even truer indication of the number of possible hands takes into account player's possible hand. It is customary to refer to bridge positions as West, North, East and South. We can apply the rule of product to get the total number of bridge hands with the following logic. West can get any of the hands identified above. Then North get 13 of the remaining 39 cards and so has possible hands. East then gets 13 of the 26 remaining cards, which has possibilities. South gets the remaining cards. Therefore the number of bridge hands is computed using the Product Rule.     The judiciary committee at a college is made up of three faculty members and four students. If ten faculty members and 25 students have been nominated for the committee, how many judiciary committees could be formed at this point?    Suppose that a single character is stored in a computer using eight bits.  a. How many bit patterns have exactly three 1's?  b. How many bit patterns have at least two 1's?

The congressional committees on mathematics and computer science are made up of five representatives each, and a congressional rule is that the two committees must be disjoint. If there are 385 members of congress, how many ways could the committees be selected?   Lattice Paths The image below shows a 6 by 6 grid and an example of a lattice path that could be taken from to , which is a path taken by traveling along grid lines going only to the right and up. How many different lattice paths are there of this type? Generalize to the case of lattice paths from to for any nonnegative integers and .   A lattice path   An example of a lattice path consisting of seven parallel horizontal line segments, equally spaced together with seven parallel vertical line segments, equally spaced. Together they form a square that is divided into 36 small squares. The bottom left point of intersection of lines is the origin and the top right is the point . A path is traced by traveling along the lines starting a the origin and ending at .    Think of each path as a sequence of instructions to go right (R) and up (U). Each path can be described as a sequence or R's and U's with exactly six of each. The six positions in which R's could be placed can be selected from the twelve positions in the sequence ways. We can generalize this logic and see that there are paths from to .  How many of the lattice paths from to pass through as the one in does?  A poker game is played with 52 cards. At the start of a game, each player gets five of the cards. The order in which cards are dealt doesn't matter.  How many hands of five cards are possible?  If there are four people playing, how many initial five-card hands are possible, taking into account all players and their positions at the table? Position with respect to the dealer does matter.         A flush in a five-card poker hand is five cards of the same suit. The suits are spades, clubs, diamonds and hearts. How many spade flushes are possible in a 52-card deck? How many flushes are possible in any suit?  How many five-card poker hands using 52 cards contain exactly two aces?   In poker, a full house is three-of-a-kind and a pair in one hand; for example, three fives and two queens. How many full houses are possible from a 52-card deck?

  "body": "Propositions and Logical Operators  Propositions  Proposition Proposition A proposition is a sentence to which one and only one of the terms true or false can be meaningfully applied.  Some Propositions  Four is even, , and are propositions.  In traditional logic, a declarative statement with a definite truth value is considered a proposition. Although our ultimate aim is to discuss mathematical logic, we won't separate ourselves completely from the traditional setting. This is natural because the basic assumptions, or postulates, of mathematical logic are modeled after the logic we use in everyday life. Since compound sentences are frequently used in everyday speech, we expect that logical propositions contain connectives like the word and. The statement Europa supports life or Mars supports life is a proposition and, hence, must have a definite truth value. Whatever that truth value is, it should be the same as the truth value of Mars supports life or Europa supports life.   Logical Operations  There are several ways in which we commonly combine simple statements into compound ones. The words\/phrases and , or , not , if ... then... , and ...if and only if ... can be added to one or more propositions to create a new proposition. To avoid any confusion, we will precisely define each one's meaning and introduce its standard symbol. With the exception of negation ( not ), all of the operations act on pairs of propositions. Since each proposition has two possible truth values, there are four ways that truth can be assigned to two propositions. In defining the effect that a logical operation has on two propositions, the result must be specified for all four cases. The most convenient way of doing this is with a truth table, which we will illustrate by defining the word and .  Logical Conjunction Conjunction, Logical   the conjunction,   If and are propositions, their conjunction, (denoted ), is defined by the truth table    Notes:   To read this truth table, you must realize that any one line represents a case: one possible set of values for and .  The numbers 0 and 1 are used to denote false and true, respectively. This is consistent with the way that many programming languages treat logical, or Boolean, variables since a single bit, 0 or 1, can represent a truth value.  For each case, the symbol under represents the truth value of . The same is true for . The symbol under represents its truth value for that case. For example, the second row of the truth table represents the case in which is false, is true, and the resulting truth value for is false. As in everyday speech, is true only when both propositions are true.  Just as the letters , and are frequently used in algebra to represent numeric variables, , and seem to be the most commonly used symbols for logical variables. When we say that is a logical variable, we mean that any proposition can take the place of .  One final comment: The order in which we list the cases in a truth table is standardized in this book. If the truth table involves two simple propositions, the numbers under the simple propositions can be interpreted as the two-digit binary integers in increasing order, 00, 01, 10, and 11, for 0, 1, 2, and 3, respectively.    Logical Disjunction Disjunction, Logical  the disjunction,   If and are propositions, their disjunction, (denoted ), is defined by the truth table    Logical Negation Negation, Logical  the negation of , not   If is a proposition, its negation, , denoted , and is defined by the truth table    Note: Negation is the only standard operator that acts on a single proposition; hence only two cases are needed.  Consider the following propositions from everyday speech:  I'm going to quit if I don't get a raise.  If I pass the final, then I'll graduate.  I'll be going to the movies provided that my car starts.    All three propositions are conditional, they can all be restated to fit into the form If Condition , then Conclusion . For example, the first statement can be rewritten as If I don't get a raise, then I'm going to quit.  A conditional statement is meant to be interpreted as a guarantee; if the condition is true, then the conclusion is expected to be true. It says no more and no less.  Conditional Statement Conditional Statement   The conditional proposition If then .   The conditional statement If then , denoted , is defined by the truth table   Truth Table for      0 0 1  0 1 1  1 0 0  1 1 1      Analysis of a Conditional Proposition Assume your instructor told you If you receive a grade of 95 or better in the final examination, then you will receive an A in this course. Your instructor has made a promise to you. If you fulfill his condition, you expect the conclusion (getting an A) to be forthcoming. Suppose your graded final has been returned to you. Has your instructor told the truth or is your instructor guilty of a falsehood?  Case I: Your final exam score was less than 95 (the condition is false) and you did not receive an A (the conclusion is false). The instructor told the truth.  Case II: Your final exam score was less than 95, yet you received an A for the course. The instructor told the truth. (Perhaps your overall course average was excellent.)  Case III: Your final exam score was greater than 95, but you did not receive an A. The instructor lied.  Case IV: Your final exam score was greater than 95, and you received an A. The instructor told the truth.  To sum up, the only case in which a conditional proposition is false is when the condition is true and the conclusion is false.   The order of the condition and conclusion in a conditional proposition is important. If the condition and conclusion are exchanged, a different proposition is produced.  Converse Converse The converse of the proposition is the proposition .  The converse of If you receive a grade of 95 or better in the final exam, then you will receive an A in this course, is If you receive an A in this course, then you received a grade of 95 or better in the final exam. It should be clear that these two statements say different things.  There is a proposition related to that does have the same logical meaning. This is the contrapositive.  Contrapositive Contrapositive  The contrapositive of the proposition is the proposition .  As we will see when we discuss logical proofs, we can prove a conditional proposition by proving its contrapositive, which may be somewhat easier.  Finally, there a third variation on the proposition , the inverse, which we will see that has the same logical meaning as the converse.  Logical Inverse  Inverse Logical  The inverse of the proposition is the proposition .  The inverse of \"If it snows today, we have a day off.\" would be \"If it doesn't snow today, we don't have a day off.\" Can you see that the original proposition and the inverse are saying different things?  Our final logical operator is a conjunction of two conditionals  Biconditional Proposition Biconditional Proposition   The biconditional proposition if and only if   If and are propositions, the biconditional statement if and only if , denoted , is defined by the truth table    Note that is true when and have the same truth values. It is common to abbreviate if and only if to iff.  Although if ... then... and ...if and only if ... are frequently used in everyday speech, there are several alternate forms that you should be aware of. They are summarized in the following lists.  All of the following are equivalent to If then :   implies .  follows from .  , only if .  , if .  is sufficient for .  is necessary for .    All of the following are equivalent to if and only if :    is necessary and sufficient for .  is equivalent to .  If , then , and if , then .  If , then and conversely.

Since each of the three simple propositions has two possible truth values, it follows that there are eight different combinations of truth values that determine a value for . These values can be obtained from a truth table for . To construct the truth table, we build from , , and and from the logical operators. The result is the truth table below.

In general, if is generated by simple propositions, then the truth table for will have rows with the first columns being an enumeration of the digit binary integers. In our example, we can see at a glance that for exactly four of the eight cases, will be true. For example, if and are true and is false (the sixth case), then is true.  Let be any set of propositions. We will give two definitions of a proposition generated by S. The first is a bit imprecise, but should be clear. The second definition is called a recursive definition . If you find it confusing, use the first definition and return to the second later.   Propositions Generated by a Set  Proposition Generated by a Set  Let be any set of propositions.

  "body": "Equivalence and Implication  Consider two propositions generated by and : and . At first glance, they are different propositions. In form, they are different, but they have the same meaning. One way to see this is to substitute actual propositions for and ; such as : I've been to Toronto; and : I've been to Chicago.  Then translates to I haven't been to both Toronto and Chicago, while is I haven't been to Toronto or I haven't been to Chicago. Determine the truth values of these propositions. Naturally, they will be true for some people and false for others. What is important is that no matter what truth values they have, and will have the same truth value. The easiest way to see this is by examining the truth tables of these propositions.   Truth Tables for and    0 0 1 1  0 1 1 1  1 0 1 1  1 1 0 0    In all four cases, and have the same truth value. Furthermore, when the biconditional operator is applied to them, the result is a value of true in all cases. A proposition such as this is called a tautology.   Tautologies and Contradictions  Tautology Tautology symbol for a tautology  An expression involving logical variables that is true in all cases is a tautology. The number 1 is used to symbolize a tautology.   Some Tautologies All of the following are tautologies because their truth tables consist of a column of 1's.   .         Contradiction Contradiction symbol for a contradiction An expression involving logical variables that is false for all cases is called a contradiction. The number 0 is used to symbolize a contradiction.  Some Contradictions  and are contradictions.    Equivalence  Equivalence Equivalence is logically equivalent to Let be a set of propositions and let and be propositions generated by . and are equivalent if and only if is a tautology. The equivalence of and is denoted .   Equivalence is to logic as equality is to algebra. Just as there are many ways of writing an algebraic expression, the same logical meaning can be expressed in many different ways.  Some Equivalences The following are all equivalences:    .   .     All tautologies are equivalent to one another.  An equivalence to .  All contradictions are equivalent to one another.  An equivalence to .   Implication  Consider the two propositions:    : The money is behind Door A; and  : The money is behind Door A or Door B.    Imagine that you were told that there is a large sum of money behind one of two doors marked A and B, and that one of the two propositions and is true and the other is false. Which door would you choose? All that you need to realize is that if is true, then will also be true. Since we know that this can't be the case, must be the true proposition and the money is behind Door B.  This is an example of a situation in which the truth of one proposition leads to the truth of another. Certainly, can be true when is false; but can't be true when is false. In this case, we say that implies .  Consider the truth table of , . If implies , then the third case can be ruled out, since it is the case that makes a conditional proposition false.  Implication  Implication  implies  Let be a set of propositions and let and be propositions generated by . We say that implies if is a tautology. We write to indicate this implication.   Disjunctive Addition A commonly used implication called disjunctive addition is , which is verified by truth table .   Truth Table to verify that      0 0 0 1  0 1 1 1  1 0 1 1  1 1 1 1    If we let represent The money is behind Door A and represent The money is behind Door B,  is a formalized version of the reasoning used in . A common name for this implication is disjunctive addition. In the next section we will consider some of the most commonly used implications and equivalences.  When we defined what we mean by a , we didn't include the conditional and biconditional operators. This was because of the two equivalences and . Therefore, any proposition that includes the conditional or biconditional operators can be written in an equivalent way using only conjunction, disjunction, and negation. We could even dispense with disjunction since is equivalent to a proposition that uses only conjunction and negation.   A Universal Operation  We close this section with a final logical operation, the Sheffer Stroke, that has the interesting property that all other logical operations can be created from it.

  "body": "The Laws of Logic   In this section, we will list the most basic equivalences and implications of logic. Most of the equivalences listed in Table should be obvious to the reader. Remember, 0 stands for contradiction, 1 for tautology. Many logical laws are similar to algebraic laws. For example, there is a logical law corresponding to the associative law of addition, . In fact, associativity of both conjunction and disjunction are among the laws of logic. Notice that with one exception, the laws are paired in such a way that exchanging the symbols , , 1 and 0 for , , 0, and 1, respectively, in any law gives you a second law. For example, results in . This is called a duality principle . For now, think of it as a way of remembering two laws for the price of one. We will leave it to the reader to verify a few of these laws with truth tables. However, the reader should be careful in applying duality to the conditional operator and implication since the dual involves taking the converse. For example, the dual of is , which is usually written .  Verification of an Identity Law The Identity Law can be verified with this truth table. The fact that is a tautology serves as a valid proof.

  "title": "Mathematical Systems and Proofs",
  "body": "Mathematical Systems and Proofs  Mathematical Systems  In this section, we present an overview of what a mathematical system is and how logic plays an important role in one. The axiomatic method that we will use here will not be duplicated with as much formality anywhere else in the book, but we hope an emphasis on how mathematical facts are developed and organized will help to unify the concepts we will present. The system of propositions and logical operators we have developed will serve as a model for our discussion. Roughly, a mathematical system can be defined as follows.  Mathematical System A mathematical system consists of:   A set or universe, .  Definitions: sentences that explain the meaning of concepts that relate to the universe. Any term used in describing the universe itself is said to be undefined. All definitions are given in terms of these undefined concepts of objects.  Axioms: assertions about the properties of the universe and rules for creating and justifying more assertions. These rules always include the system of logic that we have developed to this point.  Theorems: the additional assertions mentioned above.    Euclidean Geometry In Euclidean geometry the universe consists of points and lines (two undefined terms). Among the definitions is a definition of parallel lines and among the axioms is the axiom that two distinct parallel lines never meet.   Propositional Calculus Propositional calculus is a formal name for the logical system that we've been discussing. The universe consists of propositions. The axioms are the truth tables for the logical operators and the key definitions are those of equivalence and implication. We use propositions to describe any other mathematical system; therefore, this is the minimum amount of structure that a mathematical system can have.   Theorem  A true proposition derived from the axioms of a mathematical system is called a theorem.  Theorems are normally expressed in terms of a finite number of propositions, , called the premises , and a proposition, , called the conclusion . These theorems take the form or more informally, For a theorem of this type, we say that the premises imply the conclusion. When a theorem is stated, it is assumed that the axioms of the system are true. In addition, any previously proven theorem can be considered an extension of the axioms and can be used in demonstrating that the new theorem is true. When the proof is complete, the new theorem can be used to prove subsequent theorems. A mathematical system can be visualized as an inverted pyramid with the axioms at the base and the theorems expanding out in various directions.   The body of knowledge in a mathematical system   Inverted pyramid of knowledge with the axioms at the narrow bottom, then early theorems at the next level up, and then new theorems in a wider area. Research is above and outside the pyramid.     Proof A proof of a theorem is a finite sequence of logically valid steps that demonstrate that the premises of a theorem imply its conclusion.   Exactly what constitutes a proof is not always clear. For example, a research mathematician might require only a few steps to prove a theorem to a colleague, but might take an hour to give an effective proof to a class of students. Therefore, what constitutes a proof often depends on the audience. But the audience is not the only factor. One of the most famous theorems in graph theory, , was proven in 1976, after over a century of effort by many mathematicians. Part of the proof consisted of having a computer check many different graphs for a certain property. Without the aid of the computer, this checking would have taken years. In the eyes of some mathematicians, this proof was considered questionable. Shorter proofs have been developed since 1976 and there is no controversy associated with The Four Color Theorem at this time.   Direct Proof  Theoretically, you can prove anything in propositional calculus with truth tables. In fact, the laws of logic stated in Section 3.4 are all theorems. Propositional calculus is one of the few mathematical systems for which any valid sentence can be determined true or false by mechanical means. A program to write truth tables is not too difficult to write; however, what can be done theoretically is not always practical. For example, is a theorem in propositional calculus. However, suppose that you wrote such a program and you had it write the truth table for The truth table will have cases. At one million cases per second, it would take approximately one hour to verify the theorem. Now if you decided to check a similar theorem, you would really have time trouble. There would be cases to check in the truth table. At one million cases per second it would take approximately days to check all cases. For most of the remainder of this section, we will discuss an alternate method for proving theorems in propositional calculus. It is the same method that we will use in a less formal way for proofs in other systems. Formal axiomatic methods would be too unwieldy to actually use in later sections. However, none of the theorems in later chapters would be stated if they couldn't be proven by the axiomatic method.  We will introduce two types of proof here, direct and indirect.  A typical direct proof Direct proof This is a theorem: . A direct proof of this theorem is:   Direct proof of   Step Proposition Justification  1. Premise  2. (1), conditional rule  3. Premise  4. (2), (3), chain rule  5. (4), contrapositive  6. Premise  7. (5), (6), chain rule  8. (7), conditional rule     Note that marks the end of a proof.  illustrates the usual method of formal proof in a formal mathematical system. The rules governing these proofs are:   A proof must end in a finite number of steps.  Each step must be either a premise or a proposition that is implied from previous steps using any valid equivalence or implication.  For a direct proof, the last step must be the conclusion of the theorem. For an indirect proof (see below), the last step must be a contradiction.  Justification Column. The column labeled justification is analogous to the comments that appear in most good computer programs. They simply make the proof more readable.   Two proofs of the same theorem Here are two direct proofs of :   Direct proof of   1. Premise  2. Premise  3. Disjunctive simplification, (1), (2)  4. Premise  5. Disjunctive simplification, (3), (4).    You are invited to justify the steps in this second proof:   Alternate proof of   1.  2.  3.  4.  5.  6.  7.  8.      The conclusion of a theorem is often a conditional proposition. The condition of the conclusion can be included as a premise in the proof of the theorem. The object of the proof is then to prove the consequence of the conclusion. This rule is justified by the logical law   Example of a proof with a conditional conclusion  The following proof of includes as a fourth premise. Inference of truth of completes the proof.   Proof of a theorem with a conditional conclusion.   1. Premise  2. Added premise  3. (1), (2), disjunction simplification  4. Premise  5. (3), (4), detachment  6. Premise  7. (5), (6), detachment.       Indirect Proof  Consider a theorem , where represents , the premises. The method of indirect proof Indirect proof is based on the equivalence . In words, this logical law states that if , then is always false; that is, is a contradiction. This means that a valid method of proof is to negate the conclusion of a theorem and add this negation to the premises. If a contradiction can be implied from this set of propositions, the proof is complete. For the proofs in this section, a contradiction will often take the form .  For proofs involving numbers, a contradiction might be or . Indirect proofs involving sets might conclude with or ( and ). Indirect proofs are often more convenient than direct proofs in certain situations. Indirect proofs are often called proofs by contradiction .  An Indirect Proof  Here is an example of an indirect proof of the theorem in .   An Indirect proof of   1. Negated conclusion  2. DeMorgan's Law, (1)  3. Conjunctive simplification, (2)  4.

(10), (11)     Proof Style  The rules allow you to list the premises of a theorem immediately; however, a proof is much easier to follow if the premises are only listed when they are needed.  Yet Another Indirect Proof  Here is an indirect proof of .   Indirect proof of   1. Negation of the conclusion  2. Premise  3. (1), (2), detachment  4. (3), disjunctive addition  5. Premise  6. (4), (5)     As we mentioned at the outset of this section, we are only presenting an overview of what a mathematical system is. For greater detail on axiomatic theories, see Stoll (1961). An excellent description of how propositional calculus plays a part in artificial intelligence is contained in Hofstadter (1980). If you enjoy the challenge of constructing proofs in propositional calculus, you should enjoy the game WFF'N PROOF (1962), by L.E. Allen.

Are the following arguments valid? If they are valid, construct formal proofs; if they aren't valid, explain why not.   If wages increase, then there will be inflation. The cost of living will not increase if there is no inflation. Wages will increase. Therefore, the cost of living will increase.  If the races are fixed or the casinos are crooked, then the tourist trade will decline. If the tourist trade decreases, then the police will be happy. The police force is never happy. Therefore, the races are not fixed.    Let stand for Wages will increase,  stand for there will be inflation, and stand for cost of living will increase. Therefore the argument is: .

If that is the case, we say that the sentence is a proposition over the set of major-league baseball players, past and present.  Proposition over a Universe  Let be a nonempty set.

  "title": "Mathematical Induction",
  "body": "Mathematical Induction  Introduction, First Example  In this section, we will examine mathematical induction, a technique for proving propositions over the positive integers. Mathematical induction reduces the proof that all of the positive integers belong to a truth set to a finite number of steps.  Formula for Triangular Numbers Consider the following proposition over the positive integers, which we will label : The sum of the positive integers from 1 to is . This is a well-known formula that is quite simple to verify for a given value of . For example, is: The sum of the positive integers from 1 to 5 is . Indeed, . However, this doesn't serve as a proof that is a tautology. All that we've established is that is in the truth set of . Since the positive integers are infinite, we certainly can't use this approach to prove the formula.   An Analogy : A proof by mathematical induction is similar to knocking over a row of closely spaced dominos that are standing on end. To knock over the dominos in , all you need to do is push the first domino over. To be assured that they all will be knocked over, some work must be done ahead of time. The dominos must be positioned so that if any domino is pushed is knocked over, it will push the next domino in the line.   An analogy for Mathematical Induction, Creative Commons photo by Ranveig Thattai   A line of dominos in the process of being knocked over.    Returning to imagine the propositions to be an infinite line of dominos. Let's see if these propositions are in the same formation as the dominos were. First, we will focus on one specific point of the line: and . We are not going to prove that either of these propositions is true, just that the truth of implies the truth of . In terms of our analogy, if is knocked over, it will knock over .  In proving , we will use as our premise. We must prove: The sum of the positive integers from 1 to 100 is . We start by observing that the sum of the positive integers from 1 to 100 is . That is, the sum of the positive integers from 1 to 100 equals the sum of the first ninety-nine plus the final number, 100. We can now apply our premise, , to the sum . After rearranging our numbers, we obtain the desired expression for : .  What we've just done is analogous to checking two dominos in a line and finding that they are properly positioned. Since we are dealing with an infinite line, we must check all pairs at once. This is accomplished by proving that for all : .  They are all lined up! Now look at : The sum of the positive integers from 1 to 1 is . Clearly, is true. This sets off a chain reaction. Since , is true. Since , is true; and so on.  The Principle of Mathematical Induction  Let be a proposition over the positive integers. If   is true, and  for all , ,  then is a tautology.   Note: The truth of is called the basis for the induction proof. The premise that is true in the second part is called the induction hypothesis . The proof that implies is called the induction step of the proof. Despite our analogy, the basis is usually done first in an induction proof. However, order doesn't really matter.   More Examples  Generalized Detachment Consider the implication over the positive integers. A proof that is a tautology follows. Basis: is . This is the logical law of detachment which we know is true. If you haven't done so yet, write out the truth table of to verify this step.  Induction: Assume that is true for some . We want to prove that must be true. That is: Here is a direct proof of :    Step Proposition Justification     Premises      ,       Premise           An example from Number Theory  For all , is a multiple of 3. An inductive proof follows:  Basis: is a multiple of 3. The basis is almost always this easy!  Induction: Assume that and is a multiple of 3. Consider . Is it a multiple of 3?  .  Yes, is the sum of two multiples of 3; therefore, it is also a multiple of 3.    Now we will discuss some of the variations of the principle of mathematical induction. The first simply allows for universes that are similar to such as or .  Principle of Mathematical Induction (Generalized)  If is a proposition over , where is any integer, then is a tautology if    is true, and  for all , .      A proof of the permutations formula  In Chapter 2, we stated that the number of different permutations of elements taken from an element set, , can be computed with the formula . We can prove this statement by induction on . For , let be the proposition .  Basis: states that if is the number of ways that elements can be selected from the empty set and arranged in order, then . This is true. A general law in combinatorics is that there is exactly one way of doing nothing.  Induction: Assume that is true for some natural number . It is left for us to prove that this assumption implies that is true. Suppose that we have a set of cardinality and want to select and arrange of its elements. There are two cases to consider, the first of which is easy. If , then there is one way of selecting zero elements from the set; hence and the formula works in this case.  The more challenging case is to verify the formula when is positive and less than or equal to . Here we count the value of by counting the number of ways that the first element in the arrangement can be filled and then counting the number of ways that the remaining elements can be filled in using the induction hypothesis.  There are possible choices for the first element. Since that leaves elements to fill in the remaining positions, there are ways of completing the arrangement. By the rule of products,     Course of Values Induction  A second variation allows for the expansion of the induction hypothesis. The course-of-values principle includes the previous generalization. It is also sometimes called strong induction .  The Course-of-Values Principle of Mathematical Induction  If is a proposition over , where is any integer, then is a tautology if    is true, and  for all , .      Prime number A prime number is defined as a positive integer that has exactly two positive divisors, 1 and itself. There are an infinite number of primes. The list of primes starts with . The proposition over that we will prove here is : can be written as the product of one or more primes. In most texts, the assertion that is a tautology would appear as  Existence of Prime Factorizations  Every positive integer greater than or equal to 2 has a prime decomposition.   If you were to encounter this theorem outside the context of a discussion of mathematical induction, it might not be obvious that the proof can be done by induction. Recognizing when an induction proof is appropriate is mostly a matter of experience. Now on to the proof!  Basis: Since 2 is a prime, it is already decomposed into primes (one of them).  Induction: Suppose that for some all of the integers have a prime decomposition. Notice the course-of-value hypothesis. Consider . Either is prime or it isn't. If is prime, it is already decomposed into primes. If not, then has a divisor, , other than 1 and . Hence, where both and are between 2 and . By the induction hypothesis, and have prime decompositions, and , respectively. Therefore, has the prime decomposition .    Peano Postulates and Induction  Mathematical induction originated in the late nineteenth century. Two mathematicians who were prominent in its development were Richard Dedekind and Giuseppe Peano. Dedekind developed a set of axioms that describe the positive integers. Peano refined these axioms and gave a logical interpretation to them. The axioms are usually called the Peano Postulates.  Peano Postulates The system of positive integers consists of a nonempty set, ; a least element of , denoted 1; and a successor function, s, with the properties   If , then there is an element of called the successor of , denoted .  No two elements of have the same successor.  No element of has as its successor.  If , , and , then .      Notes:   You might recognize as simply being .  Axiom 4 is the one that makes mathematical induction possible. In an induction proof, we simply apply that axiom to the truth set of a proposition.     Exercises  Prove that the sum of the first odd integers equals . We wish to prove that is true for . Recall that the th odd positive integer is .  Basis: for , is , which is true  Induction: Assume that for some , is true. Then we infer that follows:    Prove that if , then .  Prove that for : .  Proof:   Basis: We note that the proposition is true when : .  Induction: Assume that the proposition is true for some . This is the induction hypothesis. Therefore, the truth of the proposition for implies the truth of the proposition for .     Prove that for : .  Use mathematical induction to show that for , .

Basis: ( ) Proven with a truth table already.  Induction: Assume the generalized DeMorgan's Law with propositions is true for some .   The number of strings of zeros and ones that contain an even number of ones is . Prove this fact by induction for . Let be the set of strings of zeros and ones of length (we assume that is known). Let be the set of the even strings, and the odd strings. The problem is to prove that for , . Clearly, , and, if for some , it follows that by the following reasoning.  We partition according to the first bit:  Since and are disjoint, we can apply the addition law. Therefore,    Let be is a multiple of 5. Prove that is a tautology over .  Suppose that there are people in a room, , and that they all shake hands with one another. Prove that handshakes will have occurred. Assume that for persons handshakes take place. If one more person enters the room, he or she will shake hands with people, Also, for , there are no handshakes, which matches the conjectured formula:    Prove that it is possible to make up any postage of eight cents or more using only three- and five-cent stamps.  Generalized associativity. It is well known that if , , and are numbers, then no matter what order the sums in the expression are taken in, the result is always the same. Call this fact and assume it is true. Prove using course-of-values induction that if , , and are numbers, then no matter what order the sums in the expression are taken in, the result is always the same. Let be has the same value no matter how it is evaluated.  Basis: may be evaluated only two ways. Since + is associative, . Hence, is true.  Induction: Assume that for some , are all true. Now consider the sum . Any of the additions in this expression can be applied last. If the th addition is applied last, we have . No matter how the expression to the left and right of the addition are evaluated, the result will always be the same by the induction hypothesis, specifically and . We now can prove that . If ,    Let be the set of all numbers that can be produced by applying any of the rules below in any order a finite number of times.  Rule 1:  Rule 2:  Rule 3: If and have been produced by the rules, then .  Rule 4: If and have been produced by the rules, then .  Prove that .

Some Universal Quantifiers   We can say that the square of every real number is non-negative symbolically with a universal quantifier: .   says that the sum of zero and any integer is .

Negation of an Existential Quantifier Over the universe of animals, define : is a fish and : lives in the water. We know that the proposition is not always true. In other words, is false. Another way of stating this fact is that there exists an animal that lives in the water and is not a fish; that is, .   Note that the negation of a universally quantified proposition is an existentially quantified proposition. In addition, when you negate an existentially quantified proposition, you get a universally quantified proposition. Symbolically,   Negation of Quantified Expressions       More Negations of Quantified Expressions   The ancient Greeks first discovered that is an irrational number; that is, is not a rational number. and both state this fact symbolically.   is equivalent to . They are either both true or both false.     Multiple Quantifiers Quantifiers Multiple  If a proposition has more than one variable, then you can quantify it more than once. For example, is a tautology over the set of all pairs of real numbers because it is true for each pair in . Another way to look at this proposition is as a proposition with two variables. The assertion that is a tautology could be quantified as or  In general, multiple universal quantifiers can be arranged in any order without logically changing the meaning of the resulting proposition. The same is true for multiple existential quantifiers. For example, is a proposition over . and are equivalent. A proposition with multiple existential quantifiers such as this one says that there are simultaneous values for the quantified variables that make the proposition true. A similar example is , which is always false; and the following are all equivalent:    When existential and universal quantifiers are mixed, the order cannot be exchanged without possibly changing the meaning of the proposition. For example, let be the positive real numbers, and have different logical values; is true, while is false.  Tips on Reading Multiply-Quantified Propositions. It is understandable that you would find propositions such as difficult to read. The trick to deciphering these expressions is to peel one quantifier off the proposition just as you would peel off the layers of an onion (but quantifiers shouldn't make you cry!). Since the outermost quantifier in is universal, says that is true for each value that can take on. Now take the time to select a value for , like 6. For the value that we selected, we get , which is obviously true since has a solution in the positive real numbers. We will get that same truth value no matter which positive real number we choose for ; therefore, is a tautology over and we are justified in saying that is true. The key to understanding propositions like on your own is to experiment with actual values for the outermost variables as we did above.  Now consider . To see that is false, we peel off the outer quantifier. Since it is an existential quantifier, all that says is that some positive real number makes : true. Choose a few values of to see if you can find one that makes true. For example, if we pick , we get , which is false, since is almost always different from 1. You should be able to convince yourself that no value of will make true. Therefore, is false.  Another way of convincing yourself that is false is to convince yourself that is true: In words, for each value of , there is a value for that makes . One such value is . Therefore, is true.  One final example that serves as a preview to how quantifiers appear in calculus.  The Limit of a Sequence> What does it mean that 0.999… = 1? The ellipsis ( ) implies that there are an infinite number of 9’s on the left of the equals sign. Any way to try to justify this equality boils down to the idea of limits. After many years of struggling with what this means, mathematicians have come up with a universally accepted interpretation involving quantifiers. It is that In calculus, the symbol is usually reserved for small positive real numbers. Let’s pick a value for and peel the universal quantifier off the statement above. Let’s try equal to . In addition we note that . With our choice of we get or This last statement is true - one value of that would work is . You just have to convince yourself that any positive value of , no matter how small, will produce a true statement. If you see that, you’ve convinced yourself that !

It is that In calculus, the symbol is usually reserved for small positive real numbers. Let’s pick a value for and peel the universal quantifier off the statement above. Let’s try equal to . In addition we note that . With our choice of we get or This last statement is true - one value of that would work is . You just have to convince yourself that any positive value of , no matter how small, will produce a true statement. If you see that, you’ve convinced yourself that !  "

  "body": "A Review of Methods of Proof  One of the major goals of this chapter is to acquaint the reader with the key concepts in the nature of proof in logic, which of course carries over into all areas of mathematics and its applications. In this section we will stop, reflect, and smell the roses, so that these key ideas are not lost in the many concepts covered in logic. In Chapter 4 we will use set theory as a vehicle for further practice and insights into methods of proof.   Key Concepts in Proof  All theorems in mathematics can be expressed in form If then ( ), or in the form if and only if ( ). The latter is equivalent to If then , and If then .   In If then ,  is the premise (or hypothesis) and is the conclusion. It is important to realize that a theorem makes a statement that is dependent on the premise being true.  There are two basic methods for proving :   Directly: Assume is true and prove is true.   Indirectly (or by contradiction): Assume is true and is false and prove that this leads to a contradiction of some premise, theorem, or basic truth.   The method of proof for If and only if theorems is found in the law . Hence to prove an If and only if statement one must prove an if . . . then ... statement and its converse.  The initial response of most people when confronted with the task of being told they must be able to read and do proofs is often Why? or I can't do proofs. To answer the first question, doing proofs or problem solving, even on the most trivial level, involves being able to read statements. First we must understand the problem and know the hypothesis; second, we must realize when we are done and we must understand the conclusion. To apply theorems or algorithms we must be able to read theorems and their proofs intelligently.  To be able to do the actual proofs of theorems we are forced to learn:   the actual meaning of the theorems, and  the basic definitions and concepts of the topic discussed.   For example, when we discuss rational numbers and refer to a number as being rational, this means we can substitute a fraction in place of , with the understanding that and are integers and . Therefore, to prove a theorem about rational numbers it is absolutely necessary that you know what a rational number looks like.  It's easy to comment on the response, I cannot do proofs. Have you tried? As elementary school students we may have been in awe of anyone who could handle algebraic expressions, especially complicated ones. We learned by trying and applying ourselves. Maybe we cannot solve all problems in algebra or calculus, but we are comfortable enough with these subjects to know that we can solve many and can express ourselves intelligently in these areas. The same remarks hold true for proofs.   The Art of Proving  First one must completely realize what is given, the hypothesis. The importance of this is usually overlooked by beginners. It makes sense, whenever you begin any task, to spend considerable time thinking about the tools at your disposal. Write down the premise in precise language. Similarly, you have to know when the task is finished. Write down the conclusion in precise language. Then you usually start with and attempt to show that follows logically. How do you begin? Basically you attack the proof the same way you solve a complicated equation in elementary algebra. You may not know exactly what each and every step is but you must try something. If we are lucky, follows naturally; if it doesn't, try something else. Often what is helpful is to work backward from . Finally, we have all learned, possibly the hard way, that mathematics is a participating sport, not a spectator sport. One learns proofs by doing them, not by watching others do them. We give several illustrations of how to set up the proofs of several examples. Our aim here is not to prove the statements given, but to concentrate on the logical procedure.  The Sum of Odd Integers We will outline a proof that the sum of any two odd integers is even. Our first step will be to write the theorem in the familiar conditional form: If and are odd integers, then is even. The premise and conclusion of this theorem should be clear now. Notice that if and are not both odd, then the conclusion may or may not be true. Our only objective is to show that the truth of the premise forces the conclusion to be true. Therefore, we can express the integers and in the form that all odd integers take; that is: This observation allows us to examine the sum and to verify that it must be even.  One final important point: This example involves two odd integers that may or may not be equal. If we use the fact that is odd and infer that for some integer , we can do a similar thing with . However, in this context we cannot write since we have already linked to . We need to use a different variable, maybe or - any other symbol that is not already used in our discussion.   The Square of an Even Integer Let . We will outline a proof that is even if and only if is even.  Outline of a proof: Since this is an If and only if theorem we must prove two things:   ( ) If is even, then is even. To do this directly, assume that is even and prove that is even. To do this indirectly, assume is even and that is odd, and reach a contradiction. It turns out that the latter of the two approaches is easiest here.  ( ) If is even, then is even. To do this directly, assume that is even and prove that is even.   Now that we have broken the theorem down into two parts and know what to prove, we proceed to prove the two implications. The final ingredient that we need is a convenient way of describing even integers. When we refer to an integer (or , or ,. . . ) as even, we can always replace it with a product of the form , where is an integer (more precisely, . In other words, for an integer to be even it must have a factor of two in its prime decomposition.   is irrational Our final example will be an outline of the proof that the square root of 2 is irrational (not an element of ). This is an example of the theorem that does not appear to be in the standard form. One way to rephrase the theorem is: If is a rational number, then . A direct proof of this theorem would require that we verify that the square of every rational number is not equal to 2. There is no convenient way of doing this, so we must turn to the indirect method of proof. In such a proof, we assume that is a rational number and that . This will lead to a contradiction. In order to reach this contradiction, we need to use the following facts:   A rational number is a quotient of two integers.  Every fraction can be reduced to lowest terms, so that the numerator and denominator have no common factor greater than 1.  If is an integer, is even if and only if is even.      Exercises  Prove that the sum of two odd positive integers is an even positive integer. You might want to read before attempting this. The given statement can be written in if , then format as: If and are two odd positive integers, then is an even integer.  Proof: Assume and are two positive odd integers. It can be shown that .  odd and positive for some ,  odd and positive for some .  Then, Therefore, is an even positive integer.   Write out a complete proof that if is an integer, is even if and only if is even.  Write out a complete proof that is irrational. Proof: (Indirect) Assume to the contrary, that is a rational number. Then there exists where and where is in lowest terms, that is, and have no common factor other than 1.   Hence both and have a common factor, namely 2, which is a contradiction.  Prove that the cube root of 2 is an irrational number.  Prove that if and are real numbers such that , then or . Proof: (Indirect) Assume and . Assume to the contrary that is false, which is equivalent to . Hence . This contradicts the assumption that .   Use the following definition of absolute value to prove the given statements: If is a real number, then the absolute value of , , is defined by:   For any real number , . Moreover, implies .

  "body": "Methods of Proof for Sets  If , , and are arbitrary sets, is it always true that ? There are a variety of ways that we could attempt to prove that this distributive law for intersection over union is indeed true. We start with a common non-proof and then work toward more acceptable methods.  Examples and Counterexamples  We could, for example, let , , and , and determine whether the distributive law is true for these values of , , and . In doing this we will have only determined that the distributive law is true for this one example. It does not prove the distributive law for all possible sets , , and and hence is an invalid method of proof. However, trying a few examples has considerable merit insofar as it makes us more comfortable with the statement in question. Indeed, if the statement is not true for the example, we have disproved the statement.  Counterexample  An example that disproves a statement is called a counterexample.  Disproving distributivity of addition over multiplication From basic algebra we learned that multiplication is distributive over addition. Is addition distributive over multiplication? That is, is always true? If we choose the values , , and , we find that . Therefore, this set of values serves as a counterexample to a distributive law of addition over multiplication.    Proof Using Venn Diagrams  In this method, we illustrate both sides of the statement via a Venn diagram and determine whether both Venn diagrams give us the same picture, For example, the left side of the distributive law is developed in and the right side in . Note that the final results give you the same shaded area.  The advantage of this method is that it is relatively quick and mechanical. The disadvantage is that it is workable only if there are a small number of sets under consideration. In addition, it doesn't work very well in a static environment like a book or test paper. Venn diagrams tend to work well if you have a potentially dynamic environment like a blackboard or video.   Development of the left side of the distributive law for sets   Development of the left side of the distributive law for sets     Development of the right side of the distributive law for sets   Development of the right side of the distributive law for sets     Proof using Set-membership Tables  Let be a subset of a universal set and let . To use this method we note that exactly one of the following is true: or . Denote the situation where by 1 and that where by 0. Working with two sets, and , and if , there are four possible outcomes of where can be. What are they? The set-membership table for is:   Membership Table for        0 0 0  0 1 1  1 0 1  1 1 1    This table illustrates that if and only if or .  In order to prove the distributive law via a set-membership table, write out the table for each side of the set statement to be proved and note that if and are two columns in a table, then the set statement is equal to the set statement if and only if corresponding entries in each row are the same.  To prove , first note that the statement involves three sets, , , and , so there are possibilities for the membership of an element in the sets.   Membership table to prove the distributive law of intersection over union    0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0  0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0  0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0  0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0  1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0  1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1  1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1  1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1    Since each entry in Column 7 is the same as the corresponding entry in Column 8, we have shown that for any sets , , and . The main advantage of this method is that it is mechanical. The main disadvantage is that it is reasonable to use only for a relatively small number of sets. If we are trying to prove a statement involving five sets, there are rows, which would test anyone's patience doing the work by hand.   Proof Using Definitions  This method involves using definitions and basic concepts to prove the given statement. This procedure forces one to learn, relearn, and understand basic definitions and concepts. It helps individuals to focus their attention on the main ideas of each topic and therefore is the most useful method of proof. One does not learn a topic by memorizing or occasionally glancing at core topics, but by using them in a variety of contexts. The word proof panics most people; however, everyone can become comfortable with proofs. Do not expect to prove every statement immediately. In fact, it is not our purpose to prove every theorem or fact encountered, only those that illustrate methods and\/or basic concepts. Throughout the text we will focus in on main techniques of proofs. Let's illustrate by proving the distributive law.   Proof Technique 1. State or restate the theorem so you understand what is given (the hypothesis) and what you are trying to prove (the conclusion).  The Distributive Law of Intersection over Union If , , and are sets, then .   What we can assume: , , and are sets.  What we are to prove: .  Commentary: What types of objects am I working with: sets? real numbers? propositions? The answer is sets: sets of elements that can be anything you care to imagine. The universe from which we draw our elements plays no part in the proof of this theorem.  We need to show that the two sets are equal. Let's call them the left-hand set ) and the right-hand set ( ). To prove that , we must prove two things: (a) , and (b) .  To prove part a and, similarly, part b, we must show that each element of is an element of . Once we have diagnosed the problem we are ready to begin.  We must prove: (a) .  Let : We must also prove (b) .  .   Proof Technique 2   To prove that , we must show that if , then .  To prove that , we must show:    and   .     To further illustrate the Proof-by-Definition technique, let's prove the following theorem.  Another Proof using Definitions If , , and are any sets, then .   Commentary; We again ask ourselves: What are we trying to prove? What types of objects are we dealing with? We realize that we wish to prove two facts: (a) , and (b) .  To prove part (a), and similarly part (b), we'll begin the same way. Let to show . What should be? What does a typical object in the look like?  Now, on to the actual proof.  (a) .  Let .   (b) .  Let .      Exercises   Prove the following:  Let , , and be sets. If and , then .  Let and be sets. Then .  Let be sets. If ( and ) then .  Let be sets. if and only if .  Let be sets. If then .    Assume that (condition of the conditional conclusion ).

By the two premises, and . Therefore, by the definition of intersection, .   (Indirect) Assume that is not a subset of . Therefore, there exists that does not belong to . . Therefore, and , a contradiction to the assumption that .  There are two cases to consider. The first is when is empty. Then the conclusion follows since both Cartesian products are empty.  If isn’t empty, we have two subcases, if is empty, , which is a subset of every set. Finally, the interesting subcase is when is not empty. Now we pick any pair . This means that is in and is in . Since is a subset of , is in and so . Therefore .    Write the converse of parts (a), (c), and (e) of Exercise 1 and prove or disprove them.

Proof Using Previously Proven Theorems  Once a few basic laws or theorems have been established, we frequently use them to prove additional theorems. This method of proof is usually more efficient than that of proof by Definition. To illustrate, let us prove the following Corollary to the Distributive Law. The term \"corollary\" is used for theorems that can be proven with relative ease from previously proven theorems.  A Corollary to the Distributive Law of Sets  Let A and B be sets. Then .    .     Proof Using the Indirect Method\/Contradiction  The procedure one most frequently uses to prove a theorem in mathematics is the Direct Method, as illustrated in and . Occasionally there are situations where this method is not applicable. Consider the following:   An Indirect Proof in Set Theory  Let be sets. If and , then .   Commentary: The usual and first approach would be to assume and is true and to attempt to prove is true. To do this you would need to show that nothing is contained in the set . Think about how you would show that something doesn't exist. It is very difficult to do directly.  The Indirect Method is much easier: If we assume the conclusion is false and we obtain a contradiction --- then the theorem must be true. This approach is on sound logical footing since it is exactly the same method of indirect proof that we discussed in .  Assume and , and . To prove that this cannot occur, let .  .

We note that each minset is formed by taking the intersection of two sets where each may be either or its complement, . Note also, given two sets, there are minsets.  Minsets are occasionally called minterms .  The reader should note that if we apply all possible combinations of the operations intersection, union, and complementation to the sets and of , the smallest sets generated will be exactly the minsets, the minimum sets. Hence the derivation of the term minset.  Next, consider the Venn diagram containing three sets, , , and . Draw it right now and count the regions! What are the minsets generated by , , and ? How many are there? Following the procedures outlined above, we note that the following are three of the minsets. What are the others?

We have now produced the elements 1, 2, 3, and 5 using , and yet we have not listed the elements 4 and 6.

After more experimenting, we might reach a conclusion that each element of appears exactly once in one of the four minsets , , and . Hence, we have a partition of . In fact this is the finest partition of in that all other partitions we could generate consist of selected unions of these minsets.  At this point, we might ask and be able to answer the question How many different subsets of our universe can we generate from and ? The answer is , which is in this case. Notice that in general, it would be impossible to find two sets from which we could generate all subsets of since there will never be more than four nonempty minsets. If we allowed ourselves three subsets and tried to generat all sets from them, then the number of minsets would be .

Minset Normal Form  Minset Normal Form  A set is said to be in minset normal form when it is expressed as the union of zero or more distinct nonempty minsets.   Notes:   The union of zero sets is the empty set, .  Minset normal form is also called canonical form .   Another Concrete Example of Minsets Let , , and .

  "body": "Basic Definitions and Operations  Matrix Order and Equality  matrix  A matrix is a rectangular array of elements of the form    A convenient way of describing a matrix in general is to designate each entry via its position in the array. That is, the entry is the entry in the third row and fourth column of the matrix . Depending on the situation, we will decide in advance to which set the entries in a matrix will belong. For example, we might assume that each entry ( , ) is a real number. In that case we would use to stand for the set of all by matrices whose entries are real numbers. If we decide that the entries in a matrix must come from a set , we use to denote all such matrices.  The Order of a Matrix A matrix that has rows and columns is called an (read by ) matrix, and is said to have order .  Since it is rather cumbersome to write out the large rectangular array above each time we wish to discuss the generalized form of a matrix, it is common practice to replace the above by . In general, matrices are often given names that are capital letters and the corresponding lower case letter is used for individual entries. For example the entry in the third row, second column of a matrix called would be .  Orders of Some Matrices , , and are , , and matrices, respectively.   Since we now understand what a matrix looks like, we are in a position to investigate the operations of matrix algebra for which users have found the most applications.  First we ask ourselves: Is the matrix equal to the matrix ? No, they are not because the corresponding entries in the second row, second column of the two matrices are not equal.  Next, is equal to ? No, although the corresponding entries in the first two columns are identical, doesn't have a third column to compare to that of . We formalize these observations in the following definition.  Equality of Matrices  A matrix is said to be equal to matrix (written ) if and only if:    and have the same order, and  all corresponding entries are equal: that is, = for all appropriate and .      Matrix Addition and Scalar Multiplication  The first two operations we introduce are very natural and are not likely cause much confusion. The first is matrix addition. It seems natural that if and , then   However, if and , is there a natural way to add them to give us ? No, the orders of the two matrices must be identical.  Matrix Addition Matrix Addition  Let and be matrices. Then is an matrix where (read The th th entry of the matrix is obtained by adding the th th entry of to the th th entry of ). If the orders of and are not identical, is not defined.  In short, is defined if and only if and are of the same order.  Another frequently used operation is that of multiplying a matrix by a number, commonly called a scalar in this context. Scalars normally come from the same set as the entries in a matrix. For example, if , a scalar can be any real number.  A Scalar Product If and if and we wish to find , it seems natural to multiply each entry of by 3 so that , and this is precisely the way scalar multiplication is defined.  Scalar Multiplication Scalar Multiplication Let be an matrix and a scalar. Then is the matrix obtained by multiplying times each entry of ; that is .    Matrix Multiplication  A definition that is more awkward to motivate is the product of two matrices. See for an attempt to do so. In time, the reader will see that the following definition of the product of matrices will be very useful, and will provide an algebraic system that is quite similar to elementary algebra.   Matrix Multiplication Matrix Multiplication Let be an matrix and let be an matrix. The product of and , denoted by , is an matrix whose th row th column entry is for and .   The mechanics of computing one entry in the product of two matrices is illustrated in .   Computation of one entry in the product of two 3 by 3 matrices   Computation of one entry in the product of two 3 by 3 matrices. Two three by three matrices are shown with row 1 of the first matrix and column 2 of the second highlighted. Row 1 of the first matrix has entries 1, -1 and 0. Column 2 of the second matrix has 2, 3 and 4. The corresponding entries are multiplied and the products are added to produce the entry in row 1, column 2 of the product matrix. That number is 1 time 2 plus -1 times 3 plus 0 times 4, which is -1.    The computation of a product can take a considerable amount of time in comparison to the time required to add two matrices. Suppose that and are matrices; then is determined performing multiplications and additions. The full product takes multiplications and additions. This compares with additions for the sum of two matrices. The product of two 10 by 10 matrices will require 1,000 multiplications and 900 additions, clearly a job that you would assign to a computer. The sum of two matrices requires a more modest 100 additions. This analysis is based on the assumption that matrix multiplication will be done using the formula that is given in the definition. There are more advanced methods that, in theory, reduce operation counts. For example, Strassen's algorithm ( ) computes the product of two by matrices in operations. There are practical issues involved in actually using the algorithm in many situations. For example, round-off error can be more of a problem than with the standard formula.  A Matrix Product Let , a matrix, and let , a matrix. Then is a matrix:   Remarks:   The product is defined only if is an matrix and is an matrix; that is, the two inner numbers must be equal. Furthermore, the order of the product matrix is the outer numbers, in this case .   It is wise to first determine the order of a product matrix. For example, if is a matrix and is a matrix, then is a matrix of the form Then to obtain, for example, , we multiply corresponding entries in the third row of times the first column of and add the results.    Multiplication with a diagonal matrix Let and . Then   The net effect is to multiply the first row of by and the second row of by 3.  Note: . The columns of are multiplied by and 3 when the order is switched.  Remarks:   An matrix is called a square matrix .  If is a square matrix, is defined and is denoted by , and , etc.  The matrices whose entries are all 0 are denoted by , or simply , when no confusion arises regarding the order. the by zero matrix    Exercises   Let , , and    Compute and .

Let , , and Compute, if possible;                   Let . Find a matrix such that and , where .     Find and where is as in Exercise 3, where and . What do you notice?   Find if .

Express the following systems of equations using matrices:              equals if and only if both of the equalities are true.  (i)                  In this exercise, we propose to show how matrix multiplication is a natural operation. Suppose a bakery produces bread, cakes and pies every weekday, Monday through Friday. Based on past sales history, the bakery produces various numbers of each product each day, summarized in the matrix . It should be noted that the order could be described as number of days by number of products. For example, on Wednesday (the third day) the number of cakes (second product in our list) that are produced is .  The main ingredients of these products are flour, sugar and eggs. We assume that other ingredients are always in ample supply, but we need to be sure to have the three main ones available. For each of the three products, The amount of each ingredient that is needed is summarized in the , or number of products by number of ingredients matrix . For example, to bake a cake (second product) we need cups of flour (first ingredient). Regarding units: flour and sugar are given in cups per unit of each product, while eggs are given in individual eggs per unit of each product. These amounts are made up , so don't used them to do your own baking!    How many cups of flour will the bakery need every Monday? Pay close attention to how you compute your answer and the units of each number.  How many eggs will the bakery need every Wednesday?  Compute the matrix product . What do you notice?  Suppose the costs of ingredients are for a cup of flour, for a cup of sugar and for one egg. How can this information be put into a matrix that can meaningfully be multiplied by one of the other matrices in this problem?      "

The Identity Matrix and Matrix Inverses  In the example above, the diagonal matrix whose diagonal entries are all 1's has the distinctive property that for any other matrix we have . For example:  Multiplying by the Identity Matrix If , then and .  In other words, the matrix behaves in matrix algebra like the real number 1; that is, as a multiplicative identity. In matrix algebra, the matrix is called simply the identity matrix. Convince yourself that if is any matrix .  Identity Matrix  Identity Matrix  The identity matrix  The diagonal matrix whose diagonal components are all 1's is called the identity matrix. If the context is clear, we simply use .  In the set of real numbers we recall that, given a nonzero real number , there exists a real number such that . We know that real numbers commute under multiplication so that the two equations can be summarized as . Further we know that . Do we have an analogous situation in ? Can we define the multiplicative inverse of an matrix ? It seems natural to imitate the definition of multiplicative inverse in the real numbers.  Matrix Inverse Inverse Matrix inverse, the multiplicative inverse of Let be an matrix. If there exists an matrix such that , then is a multiplicative inverse of (called simply an inverse of ) and is denoted by  When we are doing computations involving matrices, it would be helpful to know that when we find , the answer we obtain is the only inverse of the given matrix. This would let us refer to the inverse of a matrix. We refrained from saying that in the definition, but the theorem below justifies it.  Remark: Those unfamiliar with the laws of matrix algebra should return to the following proof after they have familiarized themselves with the Laws of Matrix Algebra in Section 5.5.  Inverses are unique The inverse of an matrix A, when it exists, is unique. Let be an matrix. Assume to the contrary, that has two (different) inverses, say and . Then   Let . What is ? Without too much difficulty, by trial and error, we determine that . This might lead us to guess that the inverse is found by taking the reciprocal of all nonzero entries of a matrix. Alas, it isn't that easy!  If , the reciprocal rule would tell us that the inverse of is . Try computing and you will see that you don't get the identity matrix. So, what is  ? In order to understand more completely the notion of the inverse of a matrix, it would be beneficial to have a formula that would enable us to compute the inverse of at least a matrix. To do this, we introduce the definition of the determinant of a matrix.  Determinant of a 2 by 2 matrix  The determinant of , 2 by 2 case  Let . The determinant of is the number .   In addition to , common notation for the determinant of matrix is . This is particularly common when writing out the whole matrix, which case we would write for the determinant of the general matrix.  Some determinants of two by two matrices If then . If then   Inverse of 2 by 2 matrix Let . If , then . See Exercise 4 at the end of this section.  Finding Inverses Can we find the inverses of the matrices in ? If then The reader should verify that .  The second matrix, , has a determinant equal to zero. If we tried to apply the formula in , we would be dividing by zero. For this reason, the formula can't be applied and in fact does not exist.  Remarks:  In general, if is a matrix and if , then does not exist.  A formula for the inverse of matrices can be derived that also involves . Hence, in general, if the determinant of a matrix is zero, the matrix does not have an inverse. However the formula for even a matrix is very long and is not the most efficient way to compute the inverse of a matrix.  In Chapter 12 we will develop a technique to compute the inverse of a higher-order matrix, if it exists.  Matrix inversion comes first in the hierarchy of matrix operations; therefore, is .    Exercises  For the given matrices find if it exists and verify that . If does not exist explain why.               Use the definition of the inverse of a matrix to find :      No inverse exists.             For the given matrices find if it exists and verify that .

We say that divides , denoted , if and only if there exists an integer such that .   Be very careful in writing about the relation divides. The vertical line symbol use for this relation, if written carelessly, can look like division. While is either true or false, is a number.  Based on the equation , we can say that is equivalent to , or divides evenly into . In fact the divides is short for divides evenly into. You might find the equation initially easier to understand, but in the long run we will find the equation more convenient.  Sometimes it is helpful to illustrate a relation with a graph. Consider . A graph of can be drawn as in . The arrows indicate that 1 is related to 4 under . Also, 2 is related to 4 under , and 3 is related to 5, while the upper arrow denotes that is a relation from the whole set into the set .   The graph of a relation   The graph of a relation. On the left, there is a set consisting of three points, 1, 2, and 3. On the right a set consisting of two points 4 and 5. Arrows corresponding to the ordered pairs (1,4), (2,4), and (3,5) connect the points in the two sets.    A typical element in a relation is an ordered pair . In some cases, can be described by actually listing the pairs which are in , as in the previous examples. This may not be convenient if is relatively large. Other notations are used with certain well-known relations. Consider the less than or equal relation on the real numbers. We could define it as a set of ordered pairs this way: However, the notation is clear and self-explanatory; it is a more natural, and hence preferred, notation to use than .

  "body": "Properties of Relations  Individual Properties  Consider the set and the relations divides and on . We notice that these two relations on have three properties in common:   Every element in divides itself and is less than or equal to itself. This is called the reflexive property.  If we search for two elements from where the first divides the second and the second divides the first, then we are forced to choose the two numbers to be the same. In other words, no two different numbers are related in both directions. The reader can verify that a similar fact is true for the relation on . This is called the antisymmetric property.  Next if we choose three values (not necessarily distinct) from such that the first divides the second and the second divides the third, then we always find that the first number divides the third. Again, the same is true if we replace divides with is less than or equal to. This is called the transitive property.   Relations that satisfy these properties are of special interest to us. Formal definitions of the properties follow.  Reflexive Relation Reflexive Relation Let be a set and let be a relation on . Then is reflexive if and only if for all .  Antisymmetric Relation Antisymmetric Relation Let be a set and let be a relation on . Then is antisymmetric if and only if whenever and then is false.   An equivalent condition for antisymmetry is that if and then . You are encouraged to convince yourself that this is true. This condition is often more convenient to prove than the definition, even though the definition is probably easier to understand.  A word of warning about antisymmetry: Students frequently find it difficult to understand this definition. Keep in mind that this term is defined through an If...then... statement. The question that you must ask is: Is it true that whenever there are elements and from where and , it follows that is not related to ? If so, then the relation is antisymmetric.  Another way to determine whether a relation is antisymmetric is to examine (or imagine) its digraph. The relation is not antisymmetric if there exists a pair of vertices that are connected by edges in both directions.  Transitive Relation Transitive Relation Let be a set and let be a relation on . is transitive if and only if whenever and then .   Partial Orderings  Not all relations have all three of the properties discussed above, but those that do are a special type of relation.  Partial Ordering Partial Ordering Poset A relation on a set that is reflexive, antisymmetric, and transitive is called a partial ordering on . A set on which there is a partial ordering relation defined is called a partially ordered set Partially ordered set or poset .  Set Containment as a Partial Ordering Let be a set. Then together with the relation (set containment) is a poset. To prove this we observe that the three properties hold, as discussed in Chapter 4.   Let . The fact that follows from the definition of subset. Hence, set containment is reflexive.  Let and assume that and . Could it be that ? No. There must be some element such that , but . This is exactly what we need to conclude that is not contained in . Hence, set containment is antisymmetric.  Let and assume that and . Does it follow that ? Yes, if , then because . Now that we have and we have assumed , we conclude that . Therefore, and so set containment is transitive.  is the graph for the set containment relation on the power set of .   Hasse Diagram Ordering Diagram is helpful insofar as it reminds us that each set is a subset of itself and shows us at a glance the relationship between the various subsets in . However, when a relation is a partial ordering, we can streamline a graph like this one. The streamlined form of a graph is called a Hasse diagram or ordering diagram . A Hasse diagram takes into account the following facts.   By the reflexive property, each vertex must be related to itself, so the arrows from a vertex to itself (called self-loops ) are not drawn in a Hasse diagram. They are simply assumed.  By the antisymmetry property, connections between two distinct elements in a directed graph can only go one way, if at all. When there is a connection, we agree to always place the second element above the first (as we do above with the connection from to ). For this reason, we can just draw a connection without an arrow, just a line.  By the transitive property, if there are edges connecting one element up to a second element and the second element up to a third element, then there will be a direct connection from the first to the third. We see this in with connected to and then connected to . Notice the edge connecting to . Whenever we identify this situation, remove the connection from the first to the third in a Hasse diagram and simply observe that an upward path of any length implies that the lower element is related to the upper one.   Using these observations as a guide, we can draw a Hasse diagram for on as in .   Hasse diagram for set containment on subsets of    Hasse diagram for set containment on subsets of    Definition of a relation using a Hasse diagram Consider the partial ordering relation whose Hasse diagram is .

Digraph for the pentagonal poset   Digraph for the pentagonal poset      A classic example of a partial ordering relation is on the real numbers, . Indeed, when graphing partial ordering relations, it is natural to plot the elements from the given poset starting with the least element to the greatest and to use terms like least,  greatest, etc. Because of this the reader should be forewarned that some texts use the symbol for arbitrary partial orderings. This can be quite confusing for the novice, so we continue to use generic letters , , etc.   Equivalence Relations Equivalence Relations  Another common property of relations is symmetry.  Symmetric Relation  Symmetric Relation Let be a relation on a set . is symmetric if and only if whenever , it follows that .  Consider the relation of equality defined on any set . Certainly implies that so equality is a symmetric relation on .  Surprisingly, equality is also an antisymmetric relation on . This is due to the fact that the condition that defines the antisymmetry property, and , is a contradiction. Remember, a conditional proposition is always true when the condition is false. So a relation can be both symmetric and antisymmetric on a set! Again recall that these terms are not negatives of one other. That said, there are very few important relations other than equality that are both symmetric and antisymmetric.  Equivalence Relation Equivalence Relation A relation on a set is called an equivalence relation if and only if it is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive.  The classic example of an equivalence relation is equality on a set . In fact, the term equivalence relation is used because those relations which satisfy the definition behave quite like the equality relation. Here is another important equivalence relation.  Equivalent Fractions Let be the set of nonzero integers. One of the most basic equivalence relations in mathematics is the relation on defined by if and only if . We will leave it to the reader to, verify that is indeed an equivalence relation. Be aware that since the elements of are ordered pairs, proving symmetry involves four numbers and transitivity involves six numbers. Two ordered pairs, and , are related if the fractions and are numerically equal.  Reflecting on these comments on fractions, we see that any fraction is a member of a set of equivalent fractions that can be exchanged for one another when doing arithmetic. This is an instance of an important property of all equivalence relations that motivates the following definition.   Equivalence Classes  Equivalence Classes  The equivalence class of a   Partition of with respect to an equivalence relation  Let be an equivalence relation on , and . The equivalence class of is the set, , of all elements to which is related. The set of all equivalence classes with respect to is denoted , read mod .    When we want to make it clear that an equivalence class defined by an element is based on a specific equivalence relation we would refer to it as the equivalence class of under . Whenever we encounter an equivalence relation on a set, we should immediately think about how the set is partitioned because of the following theorem.   Let be an equivalence relation on . Then the set of all distinct equivalence classes determined by form a partition of denoted and read mod .  We leave it to the reader to prove this theorem. All three properties of an equivalence relation play a role in the proof.   Our next example involves the following fundamental relations on the set of integers.  Congruence Modulo  Congruence Modulo  is congruent to modulo  is congruent to modulo  Let be a positive integer, . We define congruence modulo n to be the relation defined on the integers by    We observe the following about congruence modulo :   This relation is reflexive, for if , .  This relation is symmetric. We can prove this through the following chain of implications. .   Finally, this relation is transitive. We leave it to the reader to prove that if and , then .   Frequently, you will see the equivalent notation for congruence modulo .  Random Relations usually have no properties Consider the relation s described by the digraph in . This was created by randomly selecting whether or not two elements from were related or not. Convince yourself that the following are true:   This relation is not reflexive.  It is not antisymmetric.  Also, it is not symmetric.  It is not transitive.  Is an equivalence relation or a partial ordering?    Digraph of a random relation   A random relation     Not every random choice of a relation will be so totally negative, but as the underlying set increases, the likelihood any of the properties are true begins to vanish.   Exercises   Prove that on the set of positive integers is a partial ordering. Note that this will imply that the relation is a partial ordering on any subset of the positive integers as well.    Divides is reflexive because, if is any positive integer, and so  Divides is antisymmetric. Suppose and are two distinct positive integers. One of them has to be less than the other, so we will assume . If , then for some positive integer , where we have . But this means that and since is not a positive integer, .  Divides is transitive.

  "body": "Matrices of Relations  We have discussed two of the many possible ways of representing a relation, namely as a digraph or as a set of ordered pairs. In this section we will discuss the representation of relations by matrices.  Representing a Relation with a Matrix  Adjacency Matrix Adjacency Matrix Let and be finite sets of cardinality and , respectively. Let be a relation from into . Then can be represented by the matrix defined by  is called the adjacency matrix (or the relation matrix) of .   A simple example  Let and let be the relation on . Since is a relation from into the same set (the of the definition), we have , , and , while , , and . Next, since   , we have  , we have  , we have   , we have   All other entries of are zero, so     Composition as Matrix Multiplication  From the definition of and of composition, we note that The adjacency matrix of is .  We do not write only for notational purposes. In fact, can be obtained from the matrix product ; however, we must use a slightly different form of arithmetic.  Boolean Arithmetic  Boolean Arithmetic Boolean arithmetic is the arithmetic defined on using Boolean addition and Boolean multiplication, defined by            Notice that from Chapter 3, this is the arithmetic of logic, where replaces or and replaces and.  Composition by Multiplication Suppose that and . Then using Boolean arithmetic, and .  Composition is Matrix Multiplication Let , , and be finite sets where is a relation from into and is a relation from into . If and are the adjacency matrices of and , respectively, then the product using Boolean arithmetic is the adjacency matrix of the composition .  Remark: A convenient help in constructing the adjacency matrix of a relation from a set into a set is to write the elements from in a column preceding the first column of the adjacency matrix, and the elements of in a row above the first row. Initially, in would be To fill in the matrix, is 1 if and only if . So that, since the pair , the entry of corresponding to the row labeled 2 and the column labeled 5 in the matrix is a 1.  Relations and Information This final example gives an insight into how relational data base programs can systematically answer questions pertaining to large masses of information. Matrices (on the left) and (on the right) define the relations and where if software can be run with operating system , and if operating system can run on computer . Although the relation between the software and computers is not implicit from the data given, we can easily compute this information. The matrix of is , which is This matrix tells us at a glance which software will run on the computers listed. In this case, all software will run on all computers with the exception of program P2, which will not run on the computer C3, and programs P3 and P4, which will not run on the computer C1.

  "title": "Closure Operations on Relations",
  "body": "Closure Operations on Relations   In Section 6.1, we studied relations and one important operation on relations, namely composition. This operation enables us to generate new relations from previously known relations. In Section 6.3, we discussed some key properties of relations. We now wish to consider the situation of constructing a new relation from an existing relation where, first, contains and, second, satisfies the transitive property.   Transitive Closure  Consider a telephone network in which the main office is connected to, and can communicate to, individuals and . Both and can communicate to another person, ; however, the main office cannot communicate with . Assume communication is only one way, as indicated. This situation can be described by the relation . We would like to change the system so that the main office can communicate with person and still maintain the previous system. We, of course, want the most economical system.  This can be rephrased as follows; Find the smallest relation which contains as a subset and which is transitive; .  Transitive Closure Transitive Closure The transitive closure of Let be a set and be a relation on . The transitive closure of , denoted by , is the smallest transitive relation that contains as a subset.  Let , and let be a relation on . This relation is called the successor relation on since each element is related to its successor. How do we compute ? By inspection we note that must be in . Let's analyze why. This is so because and , and the transitive property forces to be in .  In general, it follows that if and then . This condition is exactly the membership requirement for the pair to be in the composition . So every element in must be an element in . So we now know that, contains at least . In particular, for this example, since and , we have   Is the relation transitive? Again, by inspection, is not an element of , but and . Therefore, the composition produces , and it must be an element of since and are required to be in . This shows that . This process must be continued until the resulting relation is transitive. If is finite, as is true in this example, the transitive closure will be obtained in a finite number of steps. For this example,   Transitive Closure on a Finite Set If is a relation on a set and , then the transitive closure of is the union of the first powers of r. That is,  Let's now consider the matrix analogue of the transitive closure.  Consider the relation on the set . The matrix of is  Recall that can be determined through computing the matrix powers . For our example,              How do we relate to the powers of ?  Matrix of a Transitive Closure Let be a relation on a finite set and its matrix. Let be the matrix of , the transitive closure of . Then , using Boolean arithmetic.  Using this theorem, we find is the matrix consisting of all , thus, is all of .   Algorithms for computing transitive closure  Let be a relation on the set with relation matrix . The matrix of the transitive closure , can be computed by the equation . By using ordinary polynomial evaluation methods, you can compute with matrix multiplications:  For example, if , .  We can make use of the fact that if is a relation matrix, due to the fact that in Boolean arithmetic. Let . Then  .  Similarly, and by induction we can prove   Notice how each matrix multiplication doubles the number of terms that have been added to the sum that you currently have computed. In algorithmic form, we can compute as follows.  Transitive Closure Algorithm  Let be a relation matrix and let be its transitive closure matrix, which is to be computed as matrix    1.0. S = R 2.0 T= S*(I+S) 3.0 While T != S 3.1 S = T 3.2 T= S*(I+S) \/\/ using Boolean arithmetic 4.0 Return T        Often the higher-powered terms in do not contribute anything to . When the condition becomes true in Step 3, this is an indication that no higher-powered terms are needed.  To compute using this algorithm, you need to perform no more than matrix multiplications, where is the least integer that is greater than or equal to . For example, if is a relation on 25 elements, no more than matrix multiplications are needed.    A second algorithm, Warshall's Algorithm, reduces computation time to the time that it takes to multiply two square matrices with the same order as the relation matrix in question.  Warshall's Algorithm  Let be an relation matrix and let be its transitive closure matrix, which is to be computed as matrix using Boolean arithmetic    1.0 T = R 2.0 for k = 1 to n: for i = 1 to n: for j = 1 to n: T[i,j]= T[i,j] + T[i,k] * T[k,j] 3.0 Return T       Exercises  Let and .

The set is called the domain of the function and the set is called the codomain .   The reader should note that a function is a relation from into with two important restrictions:   Each element in the set , the domain of , must be related to some element of , the codomain.  The phrase is related to exactly one element of the set means that if and , then .   A function as a list of ordered pairs  Let and , and if , then is a function from into .  A function as a set of ordered pairs in set-builder notation Let be the real numbers. Then is a function from into , or, more simply, is a function on .  It is customary to use a different system of notation for functions than the one we used for relations. If is a function from the set into the set , we will write .  The reader is probably more familiar with the notation for describing functions that is used in basic algebra or calculus courses. For example, or both define the function . Here the domain was assumed to be those elements of whose substitutions for make sense, the nonzero real numbers, and the codomain was assumed to be . In most cases, we will make a point of listing the domain and codomain in addition to describing what the function does in order to define a function.  The terms mapping , map , and transformation are also used for functions.  The Set of Functions Between Two Sets  Set of Functions Between Two Sets Functions Between Two Sets Set of  The set of all functions from into Given two sets, and , the set of all functions from into is denoted .  The notation used for sets of functions makes sense in light of .  One way to imagine a function and what it does is to think of it as a machine. The machine could be mechanical, electronic, hydraulic, or abstract. Imagine that the machine only accepts certain objects as raw materials or input. The possible raw materials make up the domain. Given some input, the machine produces a finished product that depends on the input. The possible finished products that we imagine could come out of this process make up the codomain.  A definition based on images We can define a function based on specifying the codomain element to which each domain element is related. For example, defined by is an alternate description of .  Image of an element under a function Image of an Element. The image of under Let , read Let be a function from the set into the set . If , then is used to denote that element of to which is related. is called the image of , or, more precisely, the image of under . We write to indicate that the image of is .  In , the image of 2 under is 4; that is, . In , the image of under is 1; that is, .  Range of a Function Range of a Function. Range of function The range of a function is the set of images of its domain. If , then the range of is denoted , and .   Note that the range of a function is a subset of its codomain. is also read as the image of the set under the function or simply the image of .  In , . Notice that 2 and 3 are not images of any element of . In addition, note that both 1 and 4 are related to more than one element of the domain: and . This does not violate the definition of a function. Go back and read the definition if this isn't clear to you.  In , the range of is equal to its codomain, . If is any real number, we can demonstrate that it belongs to by finding a real number for which . By the definition of , , which leads us to the equation . This equation always has a solution, ; thus .  The formula that we used to describe the image of a real number under , , is preferred over the set notation for due to its brevity. Any time a function can be described with a rule or formula, we will use this form of description. In , the image of each element of is its square. To describe that fact, we write ( ), or defined by .  There are many ways that a function can be described. Many factors, such as the complexity of the function, dictate its representation.  Data as a function Suppose a survey of 1,000 persons is done asking how many hours of television each watches per day. Consider the function defined by This function will probably have no formula such as the ones for and above.  Conditional definition of a function Consider the function defined by the set No simple single formula could describe , but if we assume that the pattern given continues, we can write    Functions of Two Variables Functions Of two Variables  If the domain of a function is the Cartesian product of two sets, then our notation and terminology changes slightly. For example, consider the function defined by . For this function, we would drop one set of parentheses and write , not . We call a function of two variables. From one point of view, this function is no different from any others that we have seen. The elements of the domain happen to be slightly more complicated. On the other hand, we can look at the individual components of the ordered pairs as being separate. If we interpret as giving us the cost of producing quantities of two products, we can imagine varying while is fixed, or vice versa.  The same observations can be made for function of three or more variables.   SageMath Note SageMath Note Functions  There are several ways to define a function in Sage. The simplest way to implement is as follows.    Sage is built upon the programming language Python, which is a strongly typed language and so you can't evaluate expressions such as f('Hello') . However a function such as , as defined above, will accept any type of number, so a bit more work is needed to restrict the inputs of to the integers.  A second way to define a function in Sage is based on Python syntax.    Non-Functions  We close this section with two examples of relations that are not functions.  A non-function Let and let . Here is not a function from into since does not act on, or use, all elements of .  Another non-function Let and let . We note that acts on all of . However, is still not a function since and and the condition on each domain being related to exactly one element of the codomain is violated.    Exercises  Let and .

  "body": "Properties of Functions Properties of Functions  Properties  Consider the following functions:  Let and , and define by   Let and , and define by   The first function, , gives us more information about the set than the second function, . Since clearly has four elements, tells us that contains at least four elements since each element of is mapped onto a different element of . The properties that has, and does not have, are the most basic properties that we look for in a function. The following definitions summarize the basic vocabulary for function properties.  Injective Function, Injection Function Injective Function One-to-one Injection  A function is injective if An injective function is called an injection, or a one-to-one function.  Notice that the condition for an injective function is logically equivalent to . for all . This is often a more convenient condition to prove than what is given in the definition.  Surjective Function, Surjection Function Surjective Function Onto Surjection  A function is surjective if its range, , is equal to its codomain, . A surjective function is called a surjection, or an onto function.  Notice that the condition for a surjective function is equivalent to .   Bijective Function, Bijection  Function Bijective  Bijection  A function is bijective if it is both injective and surjective. Bijective functions are also called one-to-one, onto functions.  The function that we opened this section with is bijective. The function is neither injective nor surjective.  Injective but not surjective function Let and , and define by , , and . Then is injective but not surjective.  Characteristic Functions The characteristic function, , in is surjective if is a proper subset of , but never injective if .   Counting  Seating Students Let be the set of students who are sitting in a classroom, let be the set of seats in the classroom, and let be the function which maps each student into the chair he or she is sitting in. When is one to one? When is it onto? Under normal circumstances, would always be injective since no two different students would be in the same seat. In order for to be surjective, we need all seats to be used, so is a surjection if the classroom is filled to capacity.   Functions can also be used for counting the elements in large finite sets or in infinite sets. Let's say we wished to count the occupants in an auditorium containing 1,500 seats. If each seat is occupied, the answer is obvious, 1,500 people. What we have done is to set up a one-to-one correspondence, or bijection, from seats to people. We formalize in a definition.  Cardinality Cardinality. has cardinality Two sets are said to have the same cardinality if there exists a bijection between them. If a set has the same cardinality as the set , then we say its cardinality is .  The function that opened this section serves to show that the two sets and have the same cardinality. Notice in applying the definition of cardinality, we don't actually appear to count either set, we just match up the elements. However, matching the letters in with the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4 is precisely how we count the letters.  Countable Set Countable Set If a set is finite or has the same cardinality as the set of positive integers, it is called a countable set.  Counting the Alphabet The alphabet has cardinality 26 through the following bijection into the set . .  As many evens as all positive integers Recall that . Paradoxically, has the same cardinality as the set of positive integers. To prove this, we must find a bijection from to . Such a function isn't unique, but this one is the simplest: where . Two statements must be proven to justify our claim that is a bijection:    is one-to-one.  Proof: Let and assume that . We must prove that .   is onto.  Proof: Let . We want to show that there exists an element such that . If , for some by the definition of . So we have . Hence, each element of 2 is the image of some element of .    Another way to look at any function with as its domain is creating a list of the form . In the previous example, the list is . This infinite list clearly has no duplicate entries and every even positive integer appears in the list eventually.  A function is a bijection if the infinite list contains no duplicates, and every element of appears on in the list. In this case, we say the is countably infinite , or simply countable .  Readers who have studied real analysis should recall that the set of rational numbers is a countable set, while the set of real numbers is not a countable set. See the exercises at the end of this section for an another example of such a set.  We close this section with a theorem called the Pigeonhole Principle, which has numerous applications even though it is an obvious, common-sense statement. Never underestimate the importance of simple ideas. The Pigeonhole Principle states that if there are more pigeons than pigeonholes, then two or more pigeons must share the same pigeonhole. A more rigorous mathematical statement of the principle follows.  The Pigeonhole Principle Pigeonhole Principle Let be a function from a finite set into a finite set . If and , then there exists an element of that is the image under of at least elements of X.  Assume no such element exists. For each , let . Then it must be that . Furthermore, the set of nonempty form a partition of . Therefore, which is a contradiction.   A duplicate name is assured Assume that a room contains four students with the first names John, James, and Mary. Prove that two students have the same first name. We can visualize a mapping from the set of students to the set of first names; each student has a first name. The pigeonhole principle applies with , and we can conclude that at least two of the students have the same first name.

Use the Pigeonhole Principle to explain why, if you pick socks at random, at least two will make up a matching pair.  Let and and define where the pair of socks that belongs to . By the Pigeonhole principle, there exist two socks that were selected from the same pair.   In your own words explain the statement The sets of integers and even integers have the same cardinality.   Let . Find functions, if they exist that have the properties specified below.   A function that is one-to-one and onto.  A function that is neither one-to-one nor onto.  A function that is one-to-one but not onto.  A function that is onto but not one-to-one.    , for example   , for example  None exist.  None exist.     Define functions, if they exist, on the positive integers, , with the same properties as in Exercise 7 (if possible).  Let and be finite sets where . Is it possible to define a function that is one-to-one but not onto? Is it possible to find a function that is onto but not one-to-one?     Prove that the set of natural numbers is countable.  Prove that the set of integers is countable.  Prove that the set of rational numbers is countable.   Use defined by .  Use the function defined by if is even and if is odd.  The proof is due to Georg Cantor (1845-1918), and involves listing the rationals through a definite procedure so that none are omitted and duplications are avoided. In the first row list all nonnegative rationals with denominator 1, in the second all nonnegative rationals with denominator 2, etc. In this listing, of course, there are duplications, for example, , , , etc. To obtain a list without duplications follow the arrows in , listing only the circled numbers.  We obtain: Each nonnegative rational appears in this list exactly once. We now must insert in this list the negative rationals, and follow the same scheme to obtain: which can be paired off with the elements of .     Enumeration of the rational numbers.       Prove that the set of finite strings of 0's and 1's is countable.  Prove that the set of odd integers is countable.  Prove that the set is countable.    Use the Pigeonhole Principle to prove that an injection cannot exist between a finite set and a finite set if the cardinality of is greater than the cardinality of .  Let be any function from into . By the Pigeonhole principle with , there exists an element of that is the image of at least two elements of . Therefore, is not an injection.  The important properties of relations are not generally of interest for functions. Most functions are not reflexive, symmetric, antisymmetric, or transitive. Can you give examples of functions that do have these properties?   Prove that the set of all infinite sequences of 0's and 1's is not a countable set.  The proof is indirect and follows a technique called the Cantor diagonal process. Assume to the contrary that the set is countable, then the elements can be listed: where each is an infinite sequence of 0s and 1s. Consider the array:   We assume that this array contains all infinite sequences of 0s and 1s. Consider the sequence defined by   Notice that differs from each in the th position and so cannot be in the list. This is a contradiction, which completes our proof.   Prove that the set of all functions on the integers is an uncountable set.   Given five points on the unit square, , prove that there are two of the points a distance of no more than from one another.    "

  "body": "Function Composition   Now that we have a good understanding of what a function is, our next step is to consider an important operation on functions. Our purpose is not to develop the algebra of functions as completely as we did for the algebras of logic, matrices, and sets, but the reader should be aware of the similarities between the algebra of functions and that of matrices. We first define equality of functions.   Function Equality  Equality of Functions Function Equality  Let ; that is, let and both be functions from into . Then is equal to (denoted ) if and only if for all .  Two functions that have different domains cannot be equal. For example, defined by and defined by are not equal even though the formula that defines them is the same.  On the other hand, it is not uncommon for two functions to be equal even though they are defined differently. For example consider the functions and , where is defined by and is defined by appear to be very different functions. However, they are equal because for .   Function Composition  One of the most important operations on functions is that of composition.  Composition of Functions  Composition of Functions  Function Composition  The composition of with  Let and . Then the composition of followed by , written , is a function from into defined by , which is read of of .   The reader should note that it is traditional to write the composition of functions from right to left. Thus, in the above definition, the first function performed in computing is . On the other hand, for relations, the composition is read from left to right, so that the first relation is .  A basic example Let be defined by , , and . Let be defined by and . Then is defined by , and . For example, . Note that is not defined. Why?  Let be defined by and let be defined by . Then, since we have is defined by . Here is also defined and is defined by . Moreover, since for at least one real number, . Therefore, the commutative law is not true for functions under the operation of composition. However, the associative law is true for functions under the operation of composition.   Function composition is associative  If , , and , then .  Note: In order to prove that two functions are equal, we must use the definition of equality of functions. Assuming that the functions have the same domain, they are equal if, for each domain element, the images of that element under the two functions are equal.  We wish to prove that for all , which is the domain of both functions. Similarly, .  Notice that no matter how the functions in the expression is grouped, the final image of any element of is and so .  If is a function on a set , then the compositions , are valid, and we denote them as , . Repeated compositions of with itself can be defined recursively. We will discuss this form of definition in detail in .  Powers of Functions  Powers of Functions  the square of a function.  Let .    ; that is, , for .   For , ; that is, for .    Two useful theorems concerning composition are given below. The proofs are left for the exercises.  The composition of injections is an injection If and are injections, then is an injection.  The composition of surjections is a surjection If and are surjections, then is a surjection.   We would now like to define the concepts of identity and inverse for functions under composition. The motivation and descriptions of the definitions of these terms come from the definitions of the terms in the set of real numbers and for matrices. For real numbers, the numbers 0 and 1 play the unique role that and for any real number . 0 and 1 are the identity elements for the reals under the operations of addition and multiplication, respectively. Similarly, the zero matrix and the identity matrix are such that for any matrix , and . Hence, an elegant way of defining the identity function under the operation of composition would be to imitate the above well-known facts.  Identity Function  Identity Function  The identity function (on a set )  For any set , the identity function on is a function from onto , denoted by (or, more specifically, ) such that for all .   Based on the definition of , we can show that for all functions , .  The identity function on  If , then the identity function is defined by , and .  The identity function on The identity function on is defined by .   Inverse Functions  We will introduce the inverse of a function with a special case: the inverse of a function on a set. After you've taken the time to understand this concept, you can read about the inverse of a function from one set into another. The reader is encouraged to reread the definition of the inverse of a matrix in Section 5.2 ( ) to see that the following definition of the inverse function is a direct analogue of that definition.  Inverse of a Function on a Set  Inverse Function of a function on a set  The inverse of function read inverse  Let . If there exists a function such that , then is called the inverse of and is denoted by , read inverse.   Notice that in the definition we refer to the inverse as opposed to an inverse. It can be proven that a function can never have more than one inverse (see exercises).  An alternate description of the inverse of a function, which can be proven from the definition, is as follows: Let be such that . Then when it exists, is a function from to such that . Note that  undoes what does.  The inverse of a function on Let and let be the function defined on such that , , and . Then is defined by , , and .  Inverse of a real function If is defined by , then is the function that undoes what does. Since cubes real numbers, must be the reverse process, namely, takes cube roots. Therefore, is defined by . We should show that and . We will do the first, and the reader is encouraged to do the second. Therefore, . Why?  The definition of the inverse of a function alludes to the fact that not all functions have inverses. How do we determine when the inverse of a function exists?  Bijections have inverses Let . exists if and only if f is a bijection; i. e. f is one-to-one and onto. ( ) In this half of the proof, assume that exists and we must prove that is one-to-one and onto. To do so, it is convenient for us to use the relation notation, where is equivalent to . To prove that is one-to-one, assume that . Alternatively, that means and are elements of . We must show that . Since , and are in . By the fact that is a function and cannot have two images, and must be equal, so is one-to-one.  Next, to prove that is onto, observe that for to be a function, it must use all of its domain, namely A. Let be any element of . Then b has an image under , . Another way of writing this is , By the definition of the inverse, this is equivalent to . Hence, is in the range of . Since was chosen arbitrarily, this shows that the range of must be all of .  ( ) Assume is one-to-one and onto and we are to prove exists. We leave this half of the proof to the reader.  Permutation Permutation A bijection of a set into itself is called a permutation of .   Next, we will consider the functions for which the domain and codomain are not necessarily equal. How do we define the inverse in this case?  Inverse of a Function (General Case) Let , If there exists a function such that and , then is called the inverse of and is denoted by , read inverse.   Note the slightly more complicated condition for the inverse in this case because the domains of and are different if and are different. The proof of the following theorem isn't really very different from the special case where .  When does a function have an inverse? Let . exists if and only if f is a bijection.  Another inverse Let and . Define by , , and . Then defined by , , and is the inverse of .    Exercises   Let , , and . Define by equal to the letter in the alphabet, and define by if is a vowel and if is a consonant.   Find .  Does it make sense to discuss ? If not, why not?  Does exist? Why?  Does exist? Why?    is defined by  No, since the domain of is not equal to the codomain of .  No, since is not surjective.  No, since is not injective.    Let . Define by , , and . Find , , and .    Let .   List all permutations of .  Find the inverse and square of each of the permutations of part a, where the square of a permutation, , is the composition .  Show that the composition of any two permutations of is a permutation of .  Prove that if is any set where , then the number of permutations of is .     The permutations of are and , defined in .     If and are permutations of , then they are both injections and their composition, , is a injection, by . By , is also a surjection; therefore, is a bijection on , a permutation.  Proof by induction: Basis: . The number of permutations of is one, the identity function, and 1! .  Induction: Assume that the number of permutations on a set with elements, , is !. Furthermore, assume that and that contains an element called . Let . We can reduce the definition of a permutation, , on to two steps. First, we select any one of the ! permutations on . (Note the use of the induction hypothesis.) Call it . This permutation almost completely defines a permutation on that we will call . For all in , we start by defining to be . We may be making some adjustments, but define it that way for now. Next, we select the image of , which can be done different ways, allowing for any value in . To keep our function bijective, we must adjust as follows: If we select , then we must find the element, , of such that , and redefine the image of to . If we had selected , then there is no adjustment needed. By the rule of products, the number of ways that we can define is      Define , , and , all functions on the integers, by , , and . Determine:           Consider the following functions on the set of bit strings of length 4. In these definitions, addition is done modulo 2, so that . Which of these functions has an inverse? For those that have an inverse, what is it? For those that don't explain why.             has an inverse. .  has an inverse. .   does not have an inverse. One way to verify this is to note that is not one-to-one because .   has an inverse.     Inverse images. If is any function from into , we can describe the inverse image as a function from into , which is also commonly denoted . If , . If does have an inverse, the inverse image of is .   Let be defined by . What are , and ?  If , where , what is ?    Let  , and all be functions from into defined by , and . Define:                      Define the following functions on the integers by , , and    Which of these functions are one-to-one?  Which of these functions are onto?  Express in simplest terms the compositions , , , , and .    Let be a nonempty set. Prove that if is a bijection on and , then is the identity function,   You have seen a similar proof in matrix algebra.  For the real matrix , .  Recall that a bijection from a set to itself is also referred to as a permutation of the set. Let be a permutation of such that becomes , becomes , etc.  Let . How many permutations of leave the determinant of invariant, that is, ?   State and prove a theorem on inverse functions analogous to the one that says that if a matrix has an inverse, that inverse is unique.   If and has an inverse, then that inverse is unique.  Proof: Suppose that and are both inverses of , both having domain and codomain .    Let and be functions whose inverses exist. Prove that .  See Exercise 3 of Section 5.4.  Prove and .   Let be elements of such that ; that is, . Since is injective, and since is injective, .  Let be an element of . We must show that there exists an element of whose image under is . Since is surjective, there exists an element of , , such that . Also, since is a surjection, there exists an element of , , such that , .   Prove the second half of .   Prove by induction that if and , are invertible functions on some nonempty set , then . The basis has been taken care of in .   Basis: : by .  Induction: Assume and and consider .    Our definition of cardinality states that two sets, and , have the same cardinality if there exists a bijection between the two sets. Why does it not matter whether the bijection is from into or into ?  Prove that has the same cardinality as is an equivalence relation on sets.    Construct a table listing as many Laws of Function Composition as you can identify. Use previous lists of laws as a guide.   Based on the definition of the identity function, show that for all functions , .     "

  "body": " The Many Faces of Recursion  Many Faces of Recursion, The  Consider the following definitions, all of which should be somewhat familiar to you. When reading them, concentrate on how they are similar.  Binomial Coefficients Polynomials and their evaluation  Here is a recursive definition of binomial coefficients, which we introduced in Chapter 2.  Binomial Coefficient - Recursion Definition Binomial Coefficient Recursive Definition Assume and . We define by    and  if    A word about definitions: Strictly speaking, when mathematical objects such as binomial coefficients are defined, they should be defined just once. Since we defined binomial coefficients earlier, in , other statements describing them should be theorems. The theorem, in this case, would be that the definition above is consistent with the original definition. Our point in this chapter in discussing recursion is to observe alternative definitions that have a recursive nature. In the exercises, you will have the opportunity to prove that the two definitions are indeed equivalent.  Here is how we can apply the recursive definition to compute .    Polynomials and Their Evaluation Polynomials  Polynomial Expression in over (Non-Recursive) Polynomial Expression Non-recursive). Let be an integer, . An degree polynomial in is an expression of the form , where are elements of some designated set of numbers, , called the set of coefficients and .  We refer to as a variable here, although the more precise term for is an indeterminate . There is a distinction between the terms indeterminate and variable, but that distinction will not come into play in our discussions.  Zeroth degree polynomials are called constant polynomials and are simply elements of the set of coefficients.  This definition is often introduced in algebra courses to describe expressions such as , a third-degree, or cubic, polynomial in . This definition has a drawback when the variable is given a value and the expression must be evaluated. For example, suppose that . Your first impulse is likely to do this:   A count of the number of operations performed shows that five multiplications and three additions\/subtractions were performed. The first two multiplications compute and , and the last three multiply the powers of 7 times the coefficients. This gives you the four terms; and adding\/subtracting a list of numbers requires addition\/subtractions. The following definition of a polynomial expression suggests another more efficient method of evaluation.  Polynomial Expression in over (Recursive) Polynomial Expression Recursive definition  Let be a set of coefficients and a variable.   A zeroth degree polynomial expression in over is a nonzero element of .  For , an degree polynomial expression in over is an expression of the form where is an degree polynomial expression in and .      We can easily verify that is a third-degree polynomial expression in over based on this definition: Notice that 4 is a zeroth degree polynomial since it is an integer. Therefore is a first-degree polynomial; therefore, is a second-degree polynomial in over ; therefore, is a third-degree polynomial in over . The final expression for is called its telescoping form . If we use it to calculate , we need only three multiplications and three additions\/subtractions. This is called Horner's method for evaluating a polynomial expression.  More Telescoping Polynomials   The telescoping form of is . Using Horner's method, computing the value of requires four multiplications and four additions\/subtractions for any real number .  has the telescoping form .    Many computer languages represent polynomials as lists of coefficients, usually starting with the constant term. For example, would be represented with the list . In both Mathematica and Sage, polynomial expressions can be entered and manipulated, so the list representation is only internal. Some programming languages require users to program polynomial operations with lists. We will leave these programming issues to another source.   Recursive Searching - The Binary Search Recursive Searching Binary Search  Next, we consider a recursive algorithm for a binary search within a sorted list of items. Suppose represent a list of items sorted by a numeric key in descending order. The item is denoted and its key value by . For example, each item might contain data on the buildings in a city and the key value might be the height of the building. Then would be the item for the tallest building and would be its height. The algorithm can be applied to search for an item in with key value . This would be accomplished by the execution of . When the algorithm is completed, the variable will have a value of if an item with the desired key value was found, and the value of will be the index of an item whose key is . If keeps the value , no such item exists in the list. The general idea behind the algorithm is illustrated in   General Scheme for a Binary Search   General Scheme for a Binary Search    In the following implementation of the Binary Search in SageMath, we search within a sorted list of integers. Therefore, the items themselves are the keys.    Recursively Defined Sequences Sequences Recursively Defined  For the next two examples, consider a sequence of numbers to be a list of numbers consisting of a zeroth number, first number, second number, ... . If a sequence is given the name , the number of is usually written or .  Geometric Growth Sequence  Define the sequence of numbers by  .  These rules stipulate that each number in the list is 1.08 times the previous number, with the starting number equal to 100. For example    The Fibonacci Sequence Fibonacci Sequence The Fibonacci sequence is the sequence defined by     Recursion  All of the previous examples were presented recursively. That is, every object is described in one of two forms. One form is by a simple definition, which is usually called the basis for the recursion. The second form is by a recursive description in which objects are described in terms of themselves, with the following qualification. What is essential for a proper use of recursion is that the objects can be expressed in terms of simpler objects, where simpler means closer to the basis of the recursion. To avoid what might be considered a circular definition, the basis must be reached after a finite number of applications of the recursion.  To determine, for example, the fourth item in the Fibonacci sequence we repeatedly apply the recursive rule for until we are left with an expression involving and :    Iteration  On the other hand, we could compute a term in the Fibonacci sequence such as by starting with the basis terms and working forward as follows:          This is called an iterative computation of the Fibonacci sequence. Here we start with the basis and work our way forward to a less simple number, such as 5. Try to compute using the recursive definition for as we did for . It will take much more time than it would have taken to do the computations above. Iterative computations usually tend to be faster than computations that apply recursion. Therefore, one useful skill is being able to convert a recursive formula into a nonrecursive formula, such as one that requires only iteration or a faster method, if possible.  An iterative formula for is also much more efficient than an application of the recursive definition. The recursive definition is not without its merits, however. First, the recursive equation is often useful in manipulating algebraic expressions involving binomial coefficients. Second, it gives us an insight into the combinatoric interpretation of . In choosing elements from , there are ways of choosing all from , and there are ways of choosing the elements if is to be selected and the remaining elements come from . Note how we used the Law of Addition from Chapter 2 in our reasoning.  BinarySearch Revisited. In the binary search algorithm, the place where recursion is used is easy to pick out. When an item is examined and the key is not the one you want, the search is cut down to a sublist of no more than half the number of items that you were searching in before. Obviously, this is a simpler search. The basis is hidden in the algorithm. The two cases that complete the search can be thought of as the basis. Either you find an item that you want, or the sublist that you have been left to search in is empty, when .  BinarySearch can be translated without much difficulty into any language that allows recursive calls to its subprograms. The advantage to such a program is that its coding would be much shorter than a nonrecursive program that does a binary search. However, in most cases the recursive version will be slower and require more memory at execution time.   Induction and Recursion Induction and Recursion  The definition of the positive integers in terms of Peano's Postulates is a recursive definition. The basis element is the number 1 and the recursion is that if is a positive integer, then so is its successor. In this case, is the simple object and the recursion is of a forward type. Of course, the validity of an induction proof is based on our acceptance of this definition. Therefore, the appearance of induction proofs when recursion is used is no coincidence.  Proof of a formula for A formula for the sequence in is for . A proof by induction follow.  If , then , as defined. Now assume that for some , the formula for is true. hence the formula is true for  The formula that we have just proven for is called a closed form expression. It involves no recursion or summation signs.   Closed Form Expression Closed Form Expression. Let be an algebraic expression involving variables which are allowed to take on values from some predetermined set. is a closed form expression if there exists a number such that the evaluation of with any allowed values of the variables will take no more than operations (alternatively, time units).

  "body": " Sequences  Sequences  Sequences and Ways They Are Defined  Sequence Sequence A sequence is a function from the natural numbers into some predetermined set. The image of any natural number can be written as or and is called the  term of . The variable is called the index or argument of the sequence.  For example, a sequence of integers would be a function .  Three sequences defined in different ways   The sequence defined by , , is a sequence of integers.  The sequence defined recursively by and for is a sequence of integers. The terms of can be computed either by applying the recursion formula or by iteration. For example, or   Let be the number of strings of 0's and 1's of length having no consecutive zeros. These terms define a sequence of integers.    Remarks:   A sequence is often called a discrete function .  Although it is important to keep in mind that a sequence is a function, another useful way of visualizing a sequence is as a list. For example, the sequence in the previous example could be written as . Finite sequences can appear much the same way when they are the input to or output from a computer. The index of a sequence can be thought of as a time variable. Imagine the terms of a sequence flashing on a screen every second. Then would be what you see in the second. It is convenient to use terminology like this in describing sequences. For example, the terms that precede the term of would be . They might be called the earlier terms.    A Fundamental Problem  Given the definition of any sequence, a fundamental problem that we will concern ourselves with is to devise a method for determining any specific term in a minimum amount of time. Generally, time can be equated with the number of operations needed. In counting operations, the application of a recursive formula would be considered an operation.   The terms of in are very easy to compute because of the closed form expression. No matter what term you decide to compute, only three operations need to be performed.  How to compute the terms of is not so clear. Suppose that you wanted to know . One approach would be to apply the definition recursively: The recursion equation for would be applied 100 times and 100 additions would then follow. To compute by this method, operations are needed. An iterative computation of is an improvement: Only additions are needed. This still isn't a good situation. As gets large, we take more and more time to compute . The formula is called a recurrence relation on . The process of finding a closed form expression for , one that requires no more than some fixed number of operations, is called solving the recurrence relation.  The determination of is a standard kind of problem in combinatorics. One solution is by way of a recurrence relation. In fact, many problems in combinatorics are most easily solved by first searching for a recurrence relation and then solving it. The following observation will suggest the recurrence relation that we need to determine . If , then every string of 0's and 1's with length and no two consecutive 0's is either or , where and are strings with no two consecutive 0's of length and respectively. From this observation we can see that for . The terms and are easy to determine by enumeration. Now, by iteration, any can be easily determined. For example, can be computed with five additions. A closed form expression for would be an improvement. Note that the recurrence relation for is identical to the one for . Only the basis is different.

  "body": " Recurrence Relations   In this section we will begin our study of recurrence relations and their solutions. Our primary focus will be on the class of finite order linear recurrence relations with constant coefficients (shortened to finite order linear relations). First, we will examine closed form expressions from which these relations arise. Second, we will present an algorithm for solving them. In later sections we will consider some other common relations (8.4) and introduce two additional tools for studying recurrence relations: generating functions (8.5) and matrix methods (Chapter 12).   Definition and Terminology  Recurrence Relation Recurrence Relation Let be a sequence of numbers. A recurrence relation on is a formula that relates all but a finite number of terms of to previous terms of . That is, there is a in the domain of such that if , then is expressed in terms of some (and possibly all) of the terms that precede . If the domain of is , the terms are not defined by the recurrence formula. Their values are the initial conditions (or boundary conditions, or basis) that complete the definition of .  Some Examples of Recurrence Relations  The Fibonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence relation , with the initial conditions and . The recurrence relation is called a second-order relation because depends on the two previous terms of . Recall that the sequence in Section 8.2, , can be defined with the same recurrence relation, but with different initial conditions.  The relation is a third-order recurrence relation. If values of , , and are specified, then is completely defined.  The recurrence relation , , with has infinite order. To determine when is even, you must go back terms. Since grows unbounded with , no finite order can be given to .    Solving Recurrence Relations Recurrence Relations Solving  Sequences are often most easily defined with a recurrence relation; however, the calculation of terms by directly applying a recurrence relation can be time-consuming. The process of determining a closed form expression for the terms of a sequence from its recurrence relation is called solving the relation. There is no single technique or algorithm that can be used to solve all recurrence relations. In fact, some recurrence relations cannot be solved. The relation that defines above is one such example. Most of the recurrence relations that you are likely to encounter in the future are classified as finite order linear recurrence relations with constant coefficients. This class is the one that we will spend most of our time with in this chapter.  Order Linear Recurrence Relation  Order of a Recurrence Relation Let be a sequence of numbers with domain . An order linear recurrence relation on with constant coefficients is a recurrence relation that can be written in the form where are constants and is a numeric function that is defined for .  Note: We will shorten the name of this class of relations to order linear relations. Therefore, in further discussions, would not be considered a first-order linear relation.  Some Finite Order Linear Relations   The Fibonacci sequence is defined by the second-order linear relation because  The relation is a third-order linear relation. In this case, .  The relation can be written as . Therefore, it is a first-order linear relation.     Recurrence Relations Obtained from Solutions Recurrence Relations Obtained from Solutions  Before giving an algorithm for solving finite order linear relations, we will examine recurrence relations that arise from certain closed form expressions. The closed form expressions are selected so that we will obtain finite order linear relations from them. This approach may seem a bit contrived, but if you were to write down a few simple algebraic expressions, chances are that most of them would be similar to the ones we are about to examine.  For our first example, consider , defined by , . If , . Therefore, satisfies the first order linear relation and the initial condition serves as an initial condition for .  As a second example, consider , . Quite a bit more algebraic manipulation is required to get our result:          .   .       The recurrence relation that we have just obtained, defined for , together with the initial conditions and , define .  summarizes our results together with a few other examples that we will let the reader derive. Based on these results, we might conjecture that any closed form expression for a sequence that combines exponential expressions and polynomial expressions will be solutions of finite order linear relations. Not only is this true, but the converse is true: a finite order linear relation defines a closed form expression that is similar to the ones that were just examined. The only additional information that is needed is a set of initial conditions.   Recurrence Relations Obtained from Given Sequences  Closed Form Expression Recurrence Relation           Homogeneous Recurrence Relation Homogeneous Recurrence Relation. An order linear relation is homogeneous if for all . For each recurrence relation , the associated homogeneous relation is   First Order Homogeneous Recurrence Relations is a first-order homogeneous relation. Since it can also be written as , it should be no surprise that it arose from an expression that involves powers of 2. More generally, you would expect that the solution of would involve . Actually, the solution is , where the value of is given by the initial condition.  A Second Order Example  Consider the second-order homogeneous relation together with the initial conditions and . From our discussion above, we can predict that the solution to this relation involves terms of the form , where and are nonzero constants that must be determined. If the solution were to equal this quantity exactly, then Substitute these expressions into the recurrence relation to get Each term on the left-hand side of this equation has a factor of , which is nonzero. Dividing through by this common factor yields  Therefore, the only possible values of are 3 and 4. Equation is called the characteristic equation of the recurrence relation. The fact is that our original recurrence relation is true for any sequence of the form , where and are real numbers. This set of sequences is called the general solution of the recurrence relation. If we didn't have initial conditions for , we would stop here. The initial conditions make it possible for us to find definite values for and .   The solution of this set of simultaneous equations is and and so the solution is .  Characteristic Equation Characteristic Equation  Characteristic Roots The characteristic equation of the homogeneous order linear relation is the th degree polynomial equation The left-hand side of this equation is called the characteristic polynomial. The roots of the characteristic polynomial are called the characteristic roots of the equation.  Some characteristic equations   The characteristic equation of is .  The characteristic equation of is Note that the absence of a term means that there is not an term appearing in the characteristic equation.      Algorithm for Solving Homogeneous Finite Order Linear Relations     Write out the characteristic equation of the relation , which is .  Find all roots of the characteristic equation, the characteristic roots.  If there are distinct characteristic roots, , then the general solution of the recurrence relation is . If there are fewer than characteristic roots, then at least one root is a multiple root. If is a double root, then the term is replaced with In general, if is a root of multiplicity , then the term is replaced with .  If initial conditions are given, we get linear equations in unknowns (the from Step 3) by substitution. If possible, solve these equations to determine a final form for .      Although this algorithm is valid for all values of , there are limits to the size of for which the algorithm is feasible. Using just a pencil and paper, we can always solve second-order equations. The quadratic formula for the roots of is The solutions of are then   Although cubic and quartic formulas exist, they are too lengthy to introduce here. For this reason, the only higher-order relations ( ) that you could be expected to solve by hand are ones for which there is an easy factorization of the characteristic polynomial.  A solution using the algorithm Suppose that is defined by , with and . We can solve this recurrence relation with :   Note that we have written the recurrence relation in nonstandard form. To avoid errors in this easy step, you might consider a rearrangement of the equation to, in this case, . Therefore, the characteristic equation is .  The characteristic roots are and . These roots can be just as easily obtained by factoring the characteristic polynomial into .  The general solution of the recurrence relation is .    The simultaneous equations have the solution and . Therefore, .    Here is one rule that might come in handy: If the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial are all integers, with the constant term equal to , then the only possible rational characteristic roots are divisors of (both positive and negative).  With the aid of a computer (or possibly only a calculator), we can increase . Approximations of the characteristic roots can be obtained by any of several well-known methods, some of which are part of standard software packages. There is no general rule that specifies the values of for which numerical approximations will be feasible. The accuracy that you get will depend on the relation that you try to solve. (See Exercise 17 of this section.)  Solution of a Third Order Recurrence Relation Solve , where , , and .  The characteristic equation is .  The only rational roots that we can attempt are . By checking these, we obtain the three roots 1, 2, and .  The general solution is . The first term can simply be written .  You can solve this system by elimination to obtain , , and . Therefore,     Solution with a Double Characteristic Root Solve , where and .   Characteristic equation: .  . Therefore, there is a double characteristic root, 4.  General solution: .    Therefore .     Solution of Nonhomogeneous Finite Order Linear Relations Nonhomogeneous of Finite Order Linear Relations Solution  Our algorithm for nonhomogeneous relations will not be as complete as for the homogeneous case. This is due to the fact that different right-hand sides ( 's) call for different rules in obtaining a particular solution.   Algorithm for Solving Nonhomogeneous Finite Order Linear Relations   To solve the recurrence relation   Write the associated homogeneous relation and find its general solution (Steps (a) through (c) of ). Call this the homogeneous solution, .  Start to obtain what is called a particular solution, of the recurrence relation by taking an educated guess at the form of a particular solution. For a large class of right-hand sides, this is not really a guess, since the particular solution is often the same type of function as (see ).  Substitute your guess from Step 2 into the recurrence relation. If you made a good guess, you should be able to determine the unknown coefficients of your guess. If you made a wrong guess, it should be apparent from the result of this substitution, so go back to Step 2.  The general solution of the recurrence relation is the sum of the homogeneous and particular solutions. If no conditions are given, then you are finished. If initial conditions are given, they will translate to linear equations in unknowns and solve the system to get a complete solution.      Particular solutions for given right-hand sides   Right Hand Side, Form of Particular Solution,  Constant, Constant,  Linear Function, Linear Function,  degree polynomial, degree polynomial,  exponential function, exponential function,    Solution of a Nonhomogeneous First Order Recurrence Relation Solve , with .   The associated homogeneous relation, has the characteristic equation ; therefore, . The homogeneous solution is .  Since the right-hand side is a constant, we guess that the particular solution will be a constant, .  If we substitute into the recurrence relation, we get , or . Therefore, .  The general solution of the recurrence relation is The initial condition will give us one equation to solve in order to determine . Therefore, and .     Solution of a Nonhomogeneous Second Order Recurrence Relation Consider with and .   From , we know that . Caution:Don't apply the initial conditions to until you add !  Since the right-hand side is a linear polynomial, is linear; that is, .  Substitution into the recurrence relation yields:  Two polynomials are equal only if their coefficients are equal. Therefore,   Use the general solution and the initial conditions to get a final solution:    Therefore, .     A quick note on interest rates  When a quantity, such as a savings account balance, is increased by some fixed percent, it is most easily computed with a multiplier. In the case of an increase, the multiplier is 1.08 because any original amount , has added to it, so that the new balance is .  Another example is that if the interest rate is , the multiplier would be 1.035. This presumes that the interest is applied at the end of year for annual interest, often called simple interest . If the interest is applied monthly, and we assume a simplifed case where each month has the same length, the multiplier after every month would be . After a year passes, this multiplier would be applied 12 times, which is the same as multiplying by . That increase from 1.035 to 1.03557 is the effect of compound interest .   A Sort of Annuity Suppose you open a savings account that pays an annual interest rate of . In addition, suppose you decide to deposit one dollar when you open the account, and you intend to double your deposit each year. Let be your balance after years. can be described by the relation , with . If, instead of doubling the deposit each year, you deposited a constant amount, , the term would be replaced with . A sequence of regular deposits such as this is called a simple annuity.  Returning to the original situation,    should be of the form .  Therefore .     Therefore, .    Matching Roots Find the general solution to .   The characteristic roots of the associated homogeneous relation are and 4. Therefore, .  A function of the form will not be a particular solution of the nonhomogeneous relation since it solves the associated homogeneous relation. When the right-hand side involves an exponential function with a base that equals a characteristic root,you should multiply your guess at a particular solution by . Our guess at would then be . See for a more complete description of this rule.  Substitute into the recurrence relation for : Each term on the left-hand side has a factor of  Therefore, .  The general solution to the recurrence relation is      When the base of right-hand side is equal to a characteristic root  If the right-hand side of a nonhomogeneous relation involves an exponential with base , and is also a characteristic root of multiplicity , then multiply your guess at a particular solution as prescribed in by , where is the index of the sequence.  Examples of matching bases  If , the characteristic roots are 4 and 5. Since 5 matches the base of the right side, will take the form .  If the only characteristic root is 3, but it is a double root (multiplicity 2). Therefore, the form of the particular solution is .  If , the characteristic roots are and 4. The form of the particular solution will be .  If , the characteristic roots are 1 and 8. If the right-hand side is a polynomial, as it is in this case, then the exponential factor can be introduced. The particular solution will take the form .     We conclude this section with a comment on the situation in which the characteristic equation gives rise to complex roots. If we restrict the coefficients of our finite order linear relations to real numbers, or even to integers, we can still encounter characteristic equations whose roots are complex. Here, we will simply take the time to point out that our algorithms are still valid with complex characteristic roots, but the customary method for expressing the solutions of these relations is different. Since an understanding of these representations requires some background in complex numbers, we will simply suggest that an interested reader can refer to a more advanced treatment of recurrence relations (see also difference equations).    Exercises    Solve the following sets of recurrence relations and initial conditions:    , ,     , ,  ,    , ,     , ,        , ,   , ,     Find a closed form expression for in Exercise 3 of Section 8.2.   Find a closed form expression for the terms of the Fibonacci sequence (see ).  The sequence was defined by = the number of strings of zeros and ones with length having no consecutive zeros ( (c)). Its recurrence relation is the same as that of the Fibonacci sequence. Determine a closed form expression for , .   The characteristic equation is , which has solutions and , It is useful to point out that and . The general solution is . Using the initial conditions, we obtain the system: and . The solution to this system is and   Therefore the final solution is     If , , then can be described with the recurrence relation . For each of the following sequences that are defined using a summation, find a closed form expression:    ,  ,  ,   ,    Let be the number of ways that the set , , can be partitioned into two nonempty subsets.   Find a recurrence relation for . (Hint: It will be a first-order linear relation.)  Solve the recurrence relation.   For each two-block partition of , there are two partitions we can create when we add , but there is one additional two-block partition to count for which one block is . Therefore,     If you were to deposit a certain amount of money at the end of each year for a number of years, this sequence of payments would be called an annuity (see ).  Find a closed form expression for the balance or value of an annuity that consists of payments of dollars at a rate of interest of . Note that for a normal annuity, the first payment is made after one year.  With an interest rate of 5.5 percent, how much would you need to deposit into an annuity to have a value of one million dollars after 18 years?  The payment of a loan is a form of annuity in which the initial value is some negative amount (the amount of the loan) and the annuity ends when the value is raised to zero. How much could you borrow if you can afford to pay $5,000 per year for 25 years at 11 percent interest?     Suppose that is a small positive number. Consider the recurrence relation , with initial conditions and . If is small enough, we might consider approximating the relation by replacing with 1 and with 0. Solve the original relation and its approximation. Let a be the solution of the approximation. Compare closed form expressions for and . Their forms are very different because the characteristic roots of the original relation were close together and the approximation resulted in one double characteristic root. If characteristic roots of a relation are relatively far apart, this problem will not occur. For example, compare the general solutions of and .     "

For each part of this section, we will consider a concrete example, present a solution, and, if possible, examine a more general form of the original relation.  A First Basic Example  Consider the homogeneous first-order linear relation without constant coefficients, , , with initial condition . Upon close examination of this relation, we see that the th term is times the term, which is a property of factorial. is a solution of this relation, for if , In addition, since , the initial condition is satisfied. It should be pointed out that from a computational point of view, our solution really isn't much of an improvement since the exact calculation of takes multiplications.  If we examine a similar relation,  with , a table of values for suggests a possible solution: The exponent of 2 in is growing according to the relation with . Thus and . Note that could also be written as , for , but this is not a closed form expression.  In general, the relation for with , where is a function that is defined for all , has the solution  This product form of is not a closed form expression because as grows, the number of multiplications grow. Thus, it is really not a true solution. Often, as for above, a closed form expression can be derived from the product form.   An Analysis of the Binary Search Algorithm   Suppose you intend to use a binary search algorithm (see ) on lists of zero or more sorted items, and that the items are stored in an array, so that you have easy access to each item. A natural question to ask is How much time will it take to complete the search? When a question like this is asked, the time we refer to is often the so-called worst-case time. That is, if we were to search through items, what is the longest amount of time that we will need to complete the search? In order to make an analysis such as this independent of the computer to be used, time is measured by counting the number of steps that are executed. Each step (or sequence of steps) is assigned an absolute time, or weight; therefore, our answer will not be in seconds, but in absolute time units. If the steps in two different algorithms are assigned weights that are consistent, then analyses of the algorithms can be used to compare their relative efficiencies. There are two major steps that must be executed in a call of the binary search algorithm:   If the lower index is less than or equal to the upper index, then the middle of the list is located and its key is compared to the value that you are searching for.  In the worst case, the algorithm must be executed with a list that is roughly half as large as in the previous execution. If we assume that Step 1 takes one time unit and is the worst-case time for a list of items, then For simplicity, we will assume that even though the conditions of Step 1 must be evaluated as false if . You might wonder why is truncated in . If is odd, then for some , the middle of the list will be the item, and no matter what half of the list the search is directed to, the reduced list will have items. On the other hand, if is even, then for . The middle of the list will be the item, and the worst case will occur if we are directed to the items that come after the middle (the through items). Again the reduced list has items.   Solution to and . To determine , the easiest case is when is a power of two. If we compute , , by iteration, our results are The pattern that is established makes it clear that . This result would seem to indicate that every time you double the size of your list, the search time increases by only one unit.  A more complete solution can be obtained if we represent in binary form. For each , there exists a non-negative integer such that For example, if , ; therefore, . If satisfies (8.4c), its binary representation requires digits. For example, = .  In general, . where . Note that in this form, is easy to describe: it is the digit binary number  Therefore, .  From the pattern that we've just established, reduces to . A formal inductive proof of this statement is possible. However, we expect that most readers would be satisfied with the argument above. Any skeptics are invited to provide the inductive proof.  For those who prefer to see a numeric example, suppose .   Our general conclusion is that the solution to and is that for , , where .  A less cumbersome statement of this fact is that . For example, .   Review of Logarithms Logarithms  Any discussion of logarithms must start by establishing a base, which can be any positive number other than 1. With the exception of , our base will be 2. We will see that the use of a different base (10 and are the other common ones) only has the effect of multiplying each logarithm by a constant. Therefore, the base that you use really isn't very important. Our choice of base 2 logarithms is convenient for the problems that we are considering.  Base 2 logarithm Logarithm, base 2 The base 2 logarithm of a positive number represents an exponent and is defined by the following equivalence for any positive real numbers . .   Plot of the logarithm, bases 2, function   Plot of the logarithm, bases 2, function    For example, because and because . A graph of the function in shows that if , the ; that is, when increases, also increases. However, if we move from to , only increases from 10 to 11. This slow rate of increase of the logarithm function is an important point to remember. An algorithm acting on pieces of data that can be executed in time units can handle significantly larger sets of data than an algorithm that can be executed in or time units. The graph of would show the same behavior.  A few more properties that we will use in subsequent discussions involving logarithms are summarized in the following theorem.  Fundamental Properties of Logarithms Logarithms Properties Let and be positive real numbers, and a real number.    Logarithms base Logarithm General Base  Logarithm, base of  If , , then for ,    How logarithms with different bases are related Let , . Then for all , . Therefore, if , base b logarithms can be computed from base 2 logarithms by dividing by the positive scaling factor . If , this scaling factor is negative.  By an analogue of , . Therefore, if we take the base 2 logarithm of both sides of this equality we get: Finally, divide both sides of the last equation by .   and .    Returning to the binary search algorithm, we can derive the final expression for using the properties of logarithms, including that the logarithm function is increasing so that inequalities are maintained when taking logarithms of numbers.     We can apply several of these properties of logarithms to get an alternate expression for :   If the time that was assigned to Step 1 of the binary search algorithm is changed, we wouldn't expect the form of the solution to be very different. If with , then .  A further generalization would be to add a coefficient to : with , where , and is not quite as simple to derive. First, if we consider values of that are powers of 2: If is not a power of 2, by reasoning that is identical to what we used to and , where .  The first term of this expression is a geometric sum, which can be written in closed form. Let be that sum: We've multiplied each term of by and aligned the identical terms in and . Now if we subtract the two equations, Therefore, .  A closed form expression for is     Analysis of Bubble Sort and Merge Sort Bubble Sort Merge Sort The efficiency of any search algorithm such as the binary search relies on fact that the search list is sorted according to a key value and that the search is based on the key value. There are several methods for sorting a list. One example is the bubble sort. You might be familiar with this one since it is a popular first sorting algorithm. A time analysis of the algorithm shows that if is the worst-case time needed to complete the bubble sort on items, then and . The solution of this relation is a quadratic function . The growth rate of a quadratic function such as this one is controlled by its squared term. Any other terms are dwarfed by it as gets large. For the bubble sort, this means that if we double the size of the list that we are to sort, changes to and so becomes . Therefore, the time needed to do a bubble sort is quadrupled. One alternative to bubble sort is the merge sort. Here is a simple version of this algorithm for sorting , . If , the list is sorted trivially. If then:   Divide into and .  Sort and using a merge sort.  Merge the sorted lists and into one sorted list. If the sort is to be done in descending order of key values, you continue to choose the higher key value from the fronts of and and place them in the back of .   Note that will always have items and will have items; thus, if is odd, gets one more item than . We will assume that the time required to perform Step 1 of the algorithm is insignificant compared to the other steps; therefore, we will assign a time value of zero to this step. Step 3 requires roughly comparisons and movements of items from and to ; thus, its time is proportional to . For this reason, we will assume that Step 3 takes time units. Since Step 2 requires time units, with the initial condition   Instead of an exact solution of these equations, we will be content with an estimate for . First, consider the case of , :   Thus, if is a power of 2, . Now if, for some , , then . This can be proved by induction on . As increases from to , increases from to and is slightly larger than . The discrepancy is small enough so that can be considered a solution of and for the purposes of comparing the merge sort with other algorithms. compares with for selected values of .

Here is a formal definition:  Derangement A derangement of a nonempty set is a permutation of (i.e., a bijection from into ) such that for all .  If , an interesting question might be How many derangements are there of ? We know that our answer is bounded above by .

Our answer will come from discovering a recurrence relation on . Suppose that . If we are to construct a derangement of , , then . Thus, the image of can be selected in different ways.

  "title": "Generating Functions",
  "body": " Generating Functions  Generating Functions  This section contains an introduction to the topic of generating functions and how they are used to solve recurrence relations, among other problems. Methods that employ generating functions are based on the concept that you can take a problem involving sequences and translate it into a problem involving generating functions. Once you've solved the new problem, a translation back to sequences gives you a solution of the original problem.  This section covers:  The definition of a generating function.  Solution of a recurrence relation using generating functions to identify the skills needed to use generating functions.  An introduction and\/or review of the skills identified in point 2.  Some applications of generating functions.    Definition  Generating Function of a Sequence  Generating Function  The generating function of a sequence with terms , is the infinite sum The domain and codomain of generating functions will not be of any concern to us since we will only be performing algebraic operations on them.   First Examples   If , , then We can get a closed form expression for by observing that . Therefore, .  Finite sequences have generating functions. For example, the sequence of binomial coefficients , , , , has generating function by application of the binomial formula.  If , . Note that the index that is used in the summation has no significance. Also, note that the lower limit of the summation could start at 1 since .     Solution of a Recurrence Relation Using Generating Functions  We illustrate the use of generating functions by solving , , with and .   Translate the recurrence relation into an equation about generating functions.  Let , , with and . Therefore,   Solve for the generating function of the unknown sequence, .   Close examination of the three sums above shows:    since and .         Therefore,     Determine the sequence whose generating function is the one we got in Step 2.  For our example, we need to know one general fact about the closed form expression of an exponential sequence (a proof will be given later):   Now, in order to recognize in our example, we must write our closed form expression for as a sum of terms like above. Note that the denominator of can be factored: If you look at this last expression for closely, you can imagine how it could be the result of addition of two fractions, where and are two real numbers that must be determined. Starting on the right of , it should be clear that the sum, for any and , would look like the left-hand side. The process of finding values of and that make true is called the partial fractions decomposition of the left-hand side:   Therefore, and   We can apply to each term of :   is the generating function for  is the generating function for .   Therefore, .    From this example, we see that there are several skills that must be mastered in order to work with generating functions. You must be able to:   Manipulate summation expressions and their indices (in Step 2).  Solve algebraic equations and manipulate algebraic expressions, including partial function decompositions (Steps 2 and 3).  Identify sequences with their generating functions (Steps 1 and 3).   We will concentrate on the last skill first, a proficiency in the other skills is a product of doing as many exercises and reading as many examples as possible.  First, we will identify the operations on sequences and on generating functions.   Operations on Sequences  Operations on Sequences  Sequences Operations on  pop  push  Convolution of sequences and  Let and be sequences of numbers and let be a real number. Define the sum , the scalar product , the product , the convolution , the pop operation (read pop ), and the push operation (read push ) term-wise for by          If one imagines a sequence to be a matrix with one row and an infinite number of columns, and are exactly as in matrix addition and scalar multiplication. There is no obvious similarity between the other operations and matrix operations.  The pop and push operations can be understood by imagining a sequence to be an infinite stack of numbers with at the top, next, etc., as in a. The sequence is obtained by popping S(0) from the stack, leaving a stack as in b, with S(1) at the top, S(2) next, etc. The sequence is obtained by placing a zero at the top of the stack, resulting in a stack as in c. Keep these figures in mind when we discuss the pop and push operations.   Stack interpretation of pop and push operation   Stack interpretation of pop and push operation    Some Sequence Operations  If , , , and :                         Note that .

Some operations on generating functions If and then      Note: , and from .   Now we establish the connection between the operations on sequences and generating functions. Let and be sequences and let be a real number.  In words, says that the generating function of the sum of two sequences equals the sum of the generating functions of those sequences. Take the time to write out the other four identities in your own words. From the previous examples, these identities should be fairly obvious, with the possible exception of the last two. We will prove as part of the next theorem and leave the proof of to the interested reader. Note that there is no operation on generating functions that is related to sequence multiplication; that is, cannot be simplified.  Generating functions related to Pop and Push If ,     .    We prove (a) by induction and leave the proof of (b) to the reader.  Basis: Therefore, part (a) is true for .  Induction: Suppose that for some , the statement in part (a) is true: by the induction hypothesis. Now write in the last expression above as so that it fits into the finite summation:   Therefore the statement is true for .    Closed Form Expressions for Generating Functions Generating Functions Closed form expressions for  The most basic tool used to express generating functions in closed form is the closed form expression for the geometric series, which is an expression of the form . It can either be terminated or extended infinitely.  Finite Geometric Series:   Infinite Geometric Series:   Restrictions: and represent constants and the right sides of the two equations apply under the following conditions:   must not equal 1 in the finite case. Note that if .  In the infinite case, the absolute value of must be less than 1.   These restrictions don't come into play with generating functions. We could derive by noting that if , , then (See Exercise 10 of Section 8.3). An alternative derivation was used in Section 8.4. We will take the same steps to derive . Let . Then   Generating Functions involving Geometric Sums   If , , is an infinite geometric series with and .Therefore, .  If , 0, then .  If , then .  Let . Then .  Given a choice between the last form of and the previous sum of three fractions, we would prefer leaving it as a sum of three functions. As we saw in an earlier example, a partial fractions decomposition of a fraction such as the last expression requires some effort to produce.  If , then can be determined by multiplying the numerator and denominator by 1\/2 to obtain . We recognize this fraction as the sum of the infinite geometric series with and . Therefore .  If , then we expand to . Therefore ,  , , and, since there are no higher-powered terms, , . A more concise way of describing is , since is interpreted as 0 of .    lists some closed form expressions for the generating functions of some common sequences.   Closed Form Expressions of some Generating Functions    Sequence Generating Function           Another Complete Solution Solve , , with and . The solution will be derived using the same steps that were used earlier in this section, with one variation.   Translate to an equation about generating functions. First, we change the index of the recurrence relation by substituting for . The result is , . Now, if , then is the zero sequence, which has a zero generating function. Furthermore, . Therefore,  We want to now solve the following equation for : Multiply by : Expand and collect all terms involving on one side of the equation: Therefore,  Determine S from its generating function. thus a partial fraction decomposition of would be: Therefore, and . The solution of this set of equations is and . . In conclusion, since , .    An Application to Counting Let and let be the set of all strings of length zero or more that can be made using each of the elements of zero or more times. By the generalized rule of products, there are such strings that have length , , Suppose that is the set of strings of length with the property that all of the 's and 's precede all of the 's, 's, and 's. Thus , but . Let . A closed form expression for can be obtained by recognizing as the convolution of two sequences. To illustrate our point, we will consider the calculation of .  Note that if a string belongs to , it starts with characters from and is followed by characters from . Let be the number of strings of 's and 's with length and let be the number of strings of 's, 's, and 's with length . By the generalized rule of products, and . Among the strings in are the ones that start with two 's and 's and end with 's, 's, and 's. There are such strings. By the law of addition, Note that the sixth term of R is the sixth term of the convolution of with , . Think about the general situation for a while and it should be clear that . Now, our course of action will be to:   Determine the generating functions of and ,  Multiply and to obtain , and  Determine on the basis of .    , and    To recognize from , we must do a partial fractions decomposition: Therefore, and . The solution of this pair of equations is and . Since , which is the sum of the generating functions of and ,   For example, . Naturally, this equals the sum that we get from . To put this number in perspective, the total number of strings of length 6 with no restrictions is , and . Therefore approximately 13 percent of the strings of length 6 satisfy the conditions of the problem.     Extra for Experts  The remainder of this section is intended for readers who have had, or who intend to take, a course in combinatorics. We do not advise that it be included in a typical course. The method that was used in the previous example is a very powerful one and can be used to solve many problems in combinatorics. We close this section with a general description of the problems that can be solved in this way, followed by some examples.  Consider the situation in which , , , are actions that must be taken, each of which results in a well-defined outcome. For each define to be the set of possible outcomes of . We will assume that each outcome can be quantified in some way and that the quantification of the elements of is defined by the function . Thus, each outcome has a non-negative integer associated with it. Finally, define a frequency function such that is the number of elements of that have a quantification of .  Now, based on these assumptions, we can define the problems that can be solved. If a process is defined as a sequence of actions as above, and if the outcome of , which would be an element of , is quantified by then the frequency function, , for is the convolution of the frequency functions for , , , , which has a generating function equal to the product of the generating functions of the frequency functions , , , . That is,   Rolling Two Dice Suppose that you roll a die two times and add up the numbers on the top face for each roll. Since the faces on the die represent the integers 1 through 6, the sum must be between 2 and 12. How many ways can any one of these sums be obtained? Obviously, 2 can be obtained only one way, with two 1's. There are two sequences that yield a sum of 3: 1-2 and 2-1. To obtain all of the frequencies with which the numbers 2 through 12 can be obtained, we set up the situation as follows. For ; is the rolling of the die for the time. and is defined by . Since each number appears on a die exactly once, the frequency function is if , and otherwise. The process of rolling the die two times is quantified by adding up the ; that is, . The generating function for the frequency function of rolling the die two times is then   Now, to get , just read the coefficient of . For example, the coefficient of is 4, so there are four ways to roll a total of 5.  To apply this method, the crucial step is to decompose a large process in the proper way so that it fits into the general situation that we've described.  Distribution of a Committee Suppose that an organization is divided into three geographic sections, A, B, and C. Suppose that an executive committee of 11 members must be selected so that no more than 5 members from any one section are on the committee and that Sections A, B, and C must have minimums of 3, 2, and 2 members, respectively, on the committee. Looking only at the number of members from each section on the committee, how many ways can the committee be made up? One example of a valid committee would be 4 A's, 4 B's, and 3 C's.  Let be the action of deciding how many members (not who) from Section A will serve on the committee. and . The frequency function, , is defined by if , with otherwise. is then . Similarly, . Since the committee must have 11 members, our answer will be the coefficient of in , which is 10.      Exercises  What sequences have the following generating functions?   1                  What sequences have the following generating functions?

For the roll, one point is added to your score if you roll a number higher than . Otherwise, your score is zero for that roll. For example, the sequence of rolls gives you a total score of three; while a sequence of 1,2,3,4,5 gives you a score of zero. Of the possible sequences of rolls, how many give you a score of zero?, of one? of five?  Coefficients of through in     Suppose that you roll a die ten times in a row and record the square of each number that you roll. How many ways could the sum of the squares of your rolls equal 40?

  "title": "Graphs - General Introduction",
  "body": " Graphs - General Introduction  Definitions  Recall that we introduced directed graphs in Chapter 6 as a tool to visualize relations on a set. Here is a formal definition.  Simple Directed Graph  Graph Simple Directed Directed Graph  A simple directed graph consists of a nonempty set of vertices , , and a set of edges , , that is a subset of the set .  Some Terminology and Comments Each edge is an ordered pair of elements from the vertex set. The first entry is the initial vertex of the edge and the second entry is the terminal vertex . Despite the set terminology in this definition, we often think of a graph as a picture, an aid in visualizing a situation. In Chapter 6, we introduced this concept to help understand relations on sets. Although those relations were principally of a mathematical nature, it remains true that when we see a graph, it tells us how the elements of a set are related to one another. We have chosen not to allow a graph with an empty vertex set, the so-called empty graph. There are both advantages and disadvantages to allowing the empty graph, so you may encounter it in other references.  A Simple Directed Graph is an example of a simple directed graph. In set terms, this graph is , where and . Note how each edge is labeled either 0 or 1. There are often reasons for labeling even simple graphs. Some labels are to help make a graph easier to discuss; others are more significant. We will discuss the significance of the labels on this graph later.   A directed graph   A directed graph     There are cases where the order of the vertices is not significant and so we use a different mathematical model for this situation:  Simple Undirected Graph  Simple Undirected Graph  Graph Simple Undirected  A simple undirected graph consists of a nonempty set , called a vertex set, and a set of two-element subsets of , called the edge set.  Henceforth, we will refer to simple undirected graphs as undirected graphs . When drawing an undirected graph, the two-element subsets are drawn as undirected lines or arcs connecting the vertices. It is customary to not allow self loops in undirected graphs since isn't a two element subset of vertices.  On Empty Graphs Empty Graph  It may occur to some readers that a graph could be empty, in the sense that it has empty vertex and edge sets. We might refer to this graph as the empty graph . However, there doesn't seem to be a universally agreed upon definition of an empty graph. In some works, a graph with any number of vertices and no edges is called an empty graph. To avoid this dilemma, we have defined both directed and undirected graphs to have nonempty vertex sets. For convenience, we've relaxed this rule in our definition of a and allowed for an empty binary tree.   An Undirected Graph A network of computers can be described easily using a graph. describes a network of five computers, , , , , and . An edge between any two vertices indicates that direct two-way communication is possible between the two computers. Note that the edges of this graph are not directed. This is due to the fact that the relation that is being displayed is symmetric (i.e., if can communicate with , then can communicate with ). Although directed edges could be used here, it would simply clutter the graph.    Communications Map   Trefoil image     Island Road Map     This undirected graph, in set terms, is and  There are several other situations for which this graph can serve as a model. One of them is to interpret the vertices as cities and the edges as roads, an abstraction of a map such as the one in . Another interpretation is as an abstraction of the floor plan of a house. See . Vertex represents the outside of the house; all others represent rooms. Two vertices are connected if there is a door between them.   Complete Undirected Graph Complete Undirected Graph. A complete undirected graph with vertices  A complete undirected graph on vertices is an undirected graph with the property that each pair of distinct vertices are connected to one another. Such a graph is usually denoted by .  In certain cases there may be a need for more than one edge between two vertices, and we need to expand the class of directed graphs.  Multigraph  Multigraph  Graph Multigraph  A multigraph is a set of vertices with a set of edges that can contain more than one edge between the vertices.  One important point to keep in mind is that if we identify a graph as being a multigraph, it isn't necessary that there are two or more edges between some of the vertices. It is only just allowed . In other words, every simple graph is a multigraph. This is analogous to how a rectangle is a more general geometric figure than a square, but a square is still considered a rectangle.  A Multigraph A common occurrence of a multigraph is a road map. The cities and towns on the map can be thought of as vertices, while the roads are the edges. It is not uncommon to have more than one road connecting two cities. In order to give clear travel directions, we name or number roads so that there is no ambiguity. We use the same method to describe the edges of the multigraph in . There is no question what is; however, referring to the edge would be ambiguous.   A directed multigraph   A directed multigraph     A Labeled Graph A flowchart is a common example of a simple graph that requires labels for its vertices and some of its edges. is one such example that illustrates how many problems are solved.   A flow chart - an example of a labeled graph   A flow chart - an example of a labeled graph    At the start of the problem-solving process, we are at the vertex labeled Start and at the end (if we are lucky enough to have solved the problem) we will be at the vertex labeled End. The sequence of vertices that we pass through as we move from Start to End is called a path. The Start vertex is called the initial vertex of the path, while the End is called the final, or terminal, vertex. Suppose that the problem is solved after two attempts; then the path that was taken is . An alternate path description would be to list the edges that were used: . This second method of describing a path has the advantage of being applicable for multigraphs. On the graph in , the vertex list does not clearly describe a path between 1 and 3, but is unambiguous.   A Summary of Path Notation and Terminology  If and are two vertices of a graph, then a path between and describes a motion from to along edges of the graph. Vertex is called the initial vertex of the path and is called the terminal vertex. A path between and can always be described by its edge list, the list of edges that were used: , where: (1) the initial vertex of is ; (2) the terminal vertex of is the initial vertex of , ; and (3) the terminal vertex of is . The number of edges in the edge list is the path length . A path on a simple graph can also be described by a vertex list. A path of length will have a list of vertices , , , where, for , is an edge on the graph. A circuit is a path that terminates at its initial vertex.  Suppose that a path between two vertices has an edge list . A subpath of this graph is any portion of the path described by one or more consecutive edges in the edge list. For example, is a subpath of . Any path is its own subpath; however, we call it an improper subpath of itself. All other nonempty subpaths are called proper subpaths.  A path or circuit is simple if it contains no proper subpath that is a circuit. This is the same as saying that a path or circuit is simple if it does not visit any vertex more than once except for the common initial and terminal vertex in the circuit. In the problem-solving method described in , the path that you take is simple only if you reach a solution on the first try.    Subgraphs  Intuitively, you could probably predict what the term subgraph means. A graph contained within a graph, right? But since a graph involves two sets, vertices and edges, does it involve a subset of both of these sets, or just one of them? The answer is it could be either. There are different types of subgraphs. The two that we will define below will meet most of our future needs in discussing the theory of graphs.  Subgraph  Subgraph  Induced Subgraph  Spanning Subgraph  Let be a graph of any kind: directed, directed multigraph, or undirected. is a subgraph of if , and only if and the vertices of are in . You create a subgraph of by removing zero or more vertices and all edges that include the removed vertices and then you possibly remove some other edges. If the only removed edges are those that include the removed vertices, then we say that is an induced subgraph . Finally, is a spanning subgraph of if , or, in other words, no vertices are removed from , only edges.  Some subgraphs  Consider the graph, , in the top left of . The other three graphs in that figure are all subgraphs of . The graph in the top right was created by first removing vertex 5 and all edges connecting it. In addition, we have removed the edge . That removed edge disqualifies the graph from being an induced subgraph. The graphs in the bottom left and right are both spanning subgraphs. The one on the bottom right is a tree, and is referred to as a spanning subtree. Spanning subtrees will be discussed in the chapter on .   A few subgraphs   A few subgraphs      One set of subgraphs of any graph is the connected components of a graph. For simplicity, we will define them for undirected graphs. Given a graph , consider the relation is connected to on . We interpret this relation so that each vertex is connected to itself, and any two distinct vertices are related if there is a path along edges of the graph from one to the other. It shouldn't be too difficult to convince yourself that this is an equivalence relation on .  Connected Component  Connected Component  Given a graph , let be the relation is connected to on . Then the connected components of are the induced subgraphs of each with a vertex set that is an equivalence class with respect to .  If you ignore the duplicate names of vertices in the four graphs of , and consider the whole figure as one large graph, then there are four connected components in that graph. It's as simple as that! It's harder to describe precisely than to understand the concept.   From the examples we've seen so far, we can see that although a graph can be defined, in short, as a collection of vertices and edges, an integral part of most graphs is the labeling of the vertices and edges that allows us to interpret the graph as a model for some situation. We continue with a few more examples to illustrate this point.  A Graph as a Model for a Set of Strings Suppose that you would like to mechanically describe the set of strings of 0's and 1's having no consecutive 1's. One way to visualize a string of this kind is with the graph in . Consider any path starting at vertex . If the label on each graph is considered to be the output to a printer, then the output will have no consecutive 1's. For example, the path that is described by the vertex list would result in an output of . Conversely, any string with no consecutive 1's determines a path starting at s.  A Tournament Graph Suppose that four teams compete in a round-robin sporting event; that is, each team meets every other team once, and each game is played until a winner is determined. If the teams are named A, B, C, and D, we can define the relation on the set of teams by if beat . For one set of results, the graph of might look like .   Round-robin tournament graph with four vertices   Round-robin tournament graph with four vertices     There are many types of tournaments and they all can be modeled by different types of graphs.  Tournament Graph Tournament Graph   A tournament graph is a directed graph with the property that no edge connects a vertex to itself, and between any two vertices there is at most one edge.  A complete (or round-robin) tournament graph is a tournament graph with the property that between any two distinct vertices there is exactly one edge.  A single-elimination tournament graph is a tournament graph with the properties that: (i) one vertex (the champion) has no edge terminating at it and at least one edge initiating from it; (ii) every other vertex is the terminal vertex of exactly one edge; and (iii) there is a path from the champion vertex to every other vertex.    Graph of a Single Elimination Tournament The major league baseball championship is decided with a single-elimination tournament, where each game is actually a series of games. From 1969 to 1994, the two divisional champions in the American League (East and West) competed in a series of games. The loser is eliminated and the winner competed against the winner of the National League series (which is decided as in the American League). The tournament graph of the 1983 championship is in   A single elimination tournament graph   A single elimination tournament graph      Graph Isomorphisms  Next, we establish the relation is isomorphic to, a form of equality on graphs. The graphs in obviously share some similarities, such as the number of vertices and the number of edges. It happens that they are even more similar than just that. If the letters , , , and in the left graph are replaced with the numbers 1,3,4, and 2, respectively, and the vertices are moved around so that they have the same position as the graph on the right, you get the graph on the right.   Isomorphic Graphs   Isomorphic Graphs    Here is a more precise definition that reflects the fact that the actual positioning (or embedding) of vertices isn't an essential part of a graph.  Isomorphic Graphs Isomorphic Graphs Two graphs and are isomorphic if there exists a bijection such that if and only if . For multigraphs, we add that the number of edges connecting to must equal the number of edges from to .  The most significant local characteristic of a vertex within a graph is its degree. Collectively, the degrees can partially characterize a graph.  Degree of a vertex Degree degree, indegree and outdegree of vertex   Let be a vertex of an undirected graph. The degree of , denoted , is the number of edges that connect to the other vertices in the graph.  If is a vertex of a directed graph, then the outdegree of , denoted , is the number of edges of the graph that initiate at . The indegree of , denoted , is the number of edges that terminate at .    Degree Sequence of a Graph Degree Sequence of a Graph  The degree sequence of a simple undirected graph is the non-increasing sequence of its vertex degrees.  Some degrees   An undirected graph      The degrees of vertices 1 through 5 in are 2, 3, 4, 1, and 2, respectively. The degree sequence of the graph is .  In a tournament graph, is the number of wins for and is the number of losses. In a complete (round-robin) tournament graph with vertices, for each vertex.    Graphic Sequence Graphic Sequence  A finite nonincreasing sequence of integers is graphic if there exists a simple undirected graph with vertices having the sequence as its degree sequence.  For example, is graphic because the degrees of the graph in match these numbers. There is no connection between the vertex number and its degree in this graph.   A graph that shows that is a graphic sequence.   A graph that shows that is a graphic sequence.    See for more details on what are also referred to as graphical degree sequences , including an algorithm for determining whether or not a sequence is graphic.   Next Steps  A Prospectus for the Rest of the Chapter The question Once you have a graph, what do you do with it? might come to mind. The following list of common questions and comments about graphs is a partial list that will give you an overview of the remainder of the chapter.   How can a graph be represented as a data structure for use on a computer? We will discuss some common data structures that are used to represent graphs in Section 9.2.  Given two vertices in a graph, does there exist a path between them? The existence of a path between any or all pairs of vertices in a graph will be discussed in Section 9.3. A related question is: How many paths of a certain type or length are there between two vertices?  Is there a path (or circuit) that passes through every vertex (or uses every edge) exactly once? Paths of this kind are called traversals. We will discuss traversals in Section 9.4.  Suppose that a cost is associated with the use of each vertex and\/or edge in a path. What is the cheapest path, circuit, or traversal of a given kind? Problems of this kind will be discussed in Section 9.5.  Given the specifications of a graph, or the graph itself, what is the best way to draw the graph? The desire for neatness alone makes this a reasonable question, but there are other motivations. Another goal might be to avoid having edges of the graph cross one another. This is discussed in Section 9.6.      Exercises  What is the significance of the fact that there is a path connecting vertex with every other vertex in , as it applies to various situations that it models?  In , computer can communicate with all other computers. In , there are direct roads to and from city to all other cities.  Draw a graph similar to that represents the set of strings of 0's and 1's containing no more than two consecutive 1's in any part of the string.  Draw a directed graph that models the set of strings of 0's and 1's (zero or more of each) where all of the 1's must appear consecutively.   Solution to exercise 3 of Section 9.1   Solution to exercise 3 of Section 9.1     In the NCAA final-four basketball tournament, the East champion plays the West champion, and the champions from the Mideast and Midwest play. The winners of the two games play for the national championship. Draw the eight different single-elimination tournament graphs that could occur.  What is the maximum number of edges in an undirected graph with eight vertices? The maximum number of edges would be .  Which of the graphs in are isomorphic? What is the correspondence between their vertices?   Which graphs are isomorphic to one another?   Graph for exercise 6 of section 9.1       How many edges does a complete tournament graph with vertices have?  How many edges does a single-elimination tournament graph with vertices have?      , each vertex except the champion vertex has an indegree of 1 and the champion vertex has an indegree of zero.    Draw complete undirected graphs with 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 vertices. How many edges does a , a complete undirected graph with vertices, have?  Determine whether the following sequences are graphic. Explain your logic.                  Not graphic - if the degree of a graph with seven vertices is 6, it is connected to all other vertices and so there cannot be a vertex with degree zero.  Graphic. One graph with this degree sequence is a cycle of length 6.  Not Graphic. The number of vertices with odd degree is odd, which is impossible.  Graphic. A \"wheel graph\" with one vertex connected to all other and the others connected to one another in a cycle has this degree sequence.  Graphic. Pairs of vertices connected only to one another.  Not Graphic. With two vertices having maximal degree, 5, every vertex would need to have a degree of 2 or more, so the 1 in this sequence makes it non-graphic.       Based on observations you might have made in exercise 9, describe as many characteristics as you can about graphic sequences of length .  Consider the two graphs in . Notice that they have the same degree sequences, . Explain why the two graphs are not isomorphic.

There are both advantages and disadvantages to allowing the empty graph, so you may encounter it in other references. "

We might refer to this graph as the empty graph . However, there doesn't seem to be a universally agreed upon definition of an empty graph. In some works, a graph with any number of vertices and no edges is called an empty graph. To avoid this dilemma, we have defined both directed and undirected graphs to have nonempty vertex sets. For convenience, we've relaxed this rule in our definition of a and allowed for an empty binary tree.  "

How can a graph be represented as a data structure for use on a computer? We will discuss some common data structures that are used to represent graphs in Section 9.2.  Given two vertices in a graph, does there exist a path between them? The existence of a path between any or all pairs of vertices in a graph will be discussed in Section 9.3. A related question is: How many paths of a certain type or length are there between two vertices?  Is there a path (or circuit) that passes through every vertex (or uses every edge) exactly once? Paths of this kind are called traversals. We will discuss traversals in Section 9.4.  Suppose that a cost is associated with the use of each vertex and\/or edge in a path. What is the cheapest path, circuit, or traversal of a given kind? Problems of this kind will be discussed in Section 9.5.  Given the specifications of a graph, or the graph itself, what is the best way to draw the graph? The desire for neatness alone makes this a reasonable question, but there are other motivations. Another goal might be to avoid having edges of the graph cross one another. This is discussed in Section 9.6.   "

  "title": "Data Structures for Graphs",
  "body": " Data Structures for Graphs  Graph Data Structures  In this section, we will describe data structures that are commonly used to represent graphs. In addition we will introduce the basic syntax for graphs in Sage.  Basic Data Structures   Data Structures for Graphs  Assume that we have a graph with vertices that can be indexed by the integers . Here are three different data structures that can be employed to represent graphs.    Adjacency Matrix: As we saw in Chapter 6, the information about edges in a graph can be summarized with an adjacency matrix, , where if and only if vertex is connected to vertex in the graph. Note that this is the same as the adjacency matrix for a relation.  Edge Dictionary: For each vertex in our graph, we maintain a list of edges that initiate at that vertex. If represents the graph's edge information, then we denote by the list of vertices that are terminal vertices of edges initiating at vertex . The exact syntax that would be used can vary. We will use Sage\/Python syntax in our examples.  Edge List: Note that in creating either of the first two data structures, we would presume that a list of edges for the graph exists. A simple way to represent the edges is to maintain this list of ordered pairs, or two element sets, depending on whether the graph is intended to be directed or undirected. We will not work with this data structure here, other than in the first example.    A Very Small Example  We consider the representation of the following graph:  Graph for a Very Small Example   Example Graph to illustrate data structures    The adjacency matrix that represents the graph would be .  The same graph could be represented with the edge dictionary   {1:[2,4],2:[3,4],3:[3],4:[1]} .  Notice the general form of each item in the dictionary: vertex:[list of vertices] .  Finally, a list of edges [(1,2),(1,4),(2,3),(2,4),(3,3),(4,1)] also describes the same graph.   A natural question to ask is: Which data structure should be used in a given situation? For small graphs, it really doesn't make much difference. For larger matrices the edge count would be a consideration. If is large and the number of edges is relatively small, it might use less memory to maintain an edge dictionary or list of edges instead of building an matrix. Some software for working with graphs will make the decision for you.  NCAA Basketball Consider the tournament graph representing a NCAA Division 1 men's (or women's) college basketball season in the United States. There are approximately 350 teams in Division 1. Suppose we constructed the graph with an edge from team A to team B if A beat B at least once in the season; and we label the edge with the number of wins. Since the average team plays around 30 games in a season, most of which will be against other Division I teams, we could expect around edges in the graph. This would be somewhat reduced by games with lower division teams and cases where two or more wins over the same team produces one edge. Since 5,250 is much smaller than entries in an adjacency matrix, an edge dictionary or edge list would be more compact than an adjacency matrix. Even if we were to use software to create an adjacency matrix, many programs will identify the fact that a matrix such as the one in this example would be sparse and would leave data in list form and use sparse array methods to work with it.    Sage Graphs  SageMath Note Graphs  The most common way to define a graph in Sage is to use an edge dictionary. Here is how the graph in is generated and then displayed. Notice that we simply wrap the function DiGraph() around the same dictionary expression we identified earlier.   You can get the adjacency matrix of a graph with the adjacency_matrix method.   You can also define a graph based on its adjacency matrix.   The edge list of any directed graph can be easily retrieved. If you replace edges with edge_iterator , you can iterate through the edge list. The third coordinate of the items in the edge is the label of the edge, which is None in this case.   Replacing the wrapper DiGraph() with Graph() creates an undirected graph.   There are many special graphs and graph families that are available in Sage through the graphs module. They are referenced with the prefix graphs. followed by the name and zero or more parameters inside parentheses. Here are a couple of them, first a complete graph with five vertices.   Here is a wheel graph, named for an obvious pattern of vertices and edges. We assign a name to it first and then show the graph without labeling the vertices.   There are dozens of graph methods, one of which determines the degree sequence of a graph. In this case, it's the wheel graph above.   The degree sequence method is defined within the graphs module, but the prefix graphs. is not needed because the value of w inherits the graphs methods.    Exercises   Estimate the number of vertices and edges in each of the following graphs. Would the graph be considered sparse, so that an adjacency matrix would be inefficient?   Vertices: Cities of the world that are served by at least one airline. Edges: Pairs of cities that are connected by a regular direct flight.  Vertices: ASCII characters. Edges: connect characters that differ in their binary code by exactly two bits.  Vertices: All English words. Edges: An edge connects word to word if is a prefix of .   A rough estimate of the number of vertices in the world airline graph would be the number of cities with population greater than or equal to 100,000. This is estimated to be around 4,100. There are many smaller cities that have airports, but some of the metropolitan areas with clusters of large cities are served by only a few airports. 4,000-5,000 is probably a good guess. As for edges, that's a bit more difficult to estimate. It's certainly not a complete graph. Looking at some medium sized airports such as Manchester, NH, the average number of cities that you can go to directly is in the 50-100 range. So a very rough estimate would be . This is far less than , so an edge list or dictionary of some kind would be more efficient.  The number of ASCII characters is 128. Each character would be connected to others and so there are edges. Comparing this to the , an array is probably the best choice.  The Oxford English Dictionary as approximately a half-million words, although many are obsolete. The number of edges is probably of the same order of magnitude as the number of words, so an edge list or dictionary is probably the best choice.   Each edge of a graph is colored with one of the four colors red, blue, yellow, or green. How could you represent the edges in this graph using a variation of the adjacency matrix structure?   Directed graphs , each with vertex set are represented by the matrices below. Which graphs are isomorphic to one another?     Each graph is isomorphic to itself. In addition, are isomorphic; and are isomorphic to one another.    The following Sage command verifies that the wheel graph with four vertices is isomorphic to the complete graph with four vertices.   A list of all graphs in this the graphs database is available via tab completion. Type \"graphs.\" and then hit the tab key to see which graphs are available.

Here are three different data structures that can be employed to represent graphs.    Adjacency Matrix: As we saw in Chapter 6, the information about edges in a graph can be summarized with an adjacency matrix, , where if and only if vertex is connected to vertex in the graph. Note that this is the same as the adjacency matrix for a relation.  Edge Dictionary: For each vertex in our graph, we maintain a list of edges that initiate at that vertex. If represents the graph's edge information, then we denote by the list of vertices that are terminal vertices of edges initiating at vertex . The exact syntax that would be used can vary. We will use Sage\/Python syntax in our examples.  Edge List: Note that in creating either of the first two data structures, we would presume that a list of edges for the graph exists. A simple way to represent the edges is to maintain this list of ordered pairs, or two element sets, depending on whether the graph is intended to be directed or undirected. We will not work with this data structure here, other than in the first example.   "

There are approximately 350 teams in Division 1. Suppose we constructed the graph with an edge from team A to team B if A beat B at least once in the season; and we label the edge with the number of wins. Since the average team plays around 30 games in a season, most of which will be against other Division I teams, we could expect around edges in the graph. This would be somewhat reduced by games with lower division teams and cases where two or more wins over the same team produces one edge. Since 5,250 is much smaller than entries in an adjacency matrix, an edge dictionary or edge list would be more compact than an adjacency matrix.

  "body": " Connectivity  Connectivity in Graphs   This section is devoted to a question that, when posed in relation to the graphs that we have examined, seems trivial. That question is: Given two vertices, and , of a graph, is there a path from to ? If , this question is interpreted as asking whether there is a circuit of positive length starting at . Of course, for the graphs we have seen up to now, this question can be answered after a brief examination.   Preliminaries  There are two situations under which a question of this kind is nontrivial. One is where the graph is very large and an examination of the graph could take a considerable amount of time. Anyone who has tried to solve a maze may have run into a similar problem. The second interesting situation is when we want to pose the question to a machine. If only the information on the edges between the vertices is part of the data structure for the graph, how can you put that information together to determine whether two vertices can be connected by a path?  Connectivity Terminology Let and be vertices of a directed graph. Vertex is connected to vertex if there is a path from to . Two vertices are strongly connected if they are connected in both directions to one another. A graph is connected if, for each pair of distinct vertices, and , is connected to or is connected to . A graph is strongly connected if every pair of its vertices is strongly connected. For an undirected graph, in which edges can be used in either direction, the notions of strongly connected and connected are the same.   Maximal Path Theorem  If a graph has vertices and vertex is connected to vertex , then there exists a path from to of length no more than . (Indirect): Suppose is connected to , but the shortest path from to has length , where . A vertex list for a path of length will have vertices. This path can be represented as , where and . Note that since there are only vertices in the graph and vertices are listed in the path after , we can apply the pigeonhole principle and be assured that there must be some duplication in the last vertices of the vertex list, which represents a circuit in the path. This means that our path of minimum length can be reduced, which is a contradiction.    Adjacency Matrix Method Adjacency Matrix Method  Adjacency Matrix Method   Suppose that the information about edges in a graph is stored in an adjacency matrix, . The relation, , that defines is if there is an edge connecting to . Recall that the composition of with itself, , is defined by if there exists a vertex such that and ; that is, is connected to by a path of length 2. We could prove by induction that the relation , , is defined by if and only if there is a path of length from to . Since the transitive closure, , is the union of ,  , we can answer our connectivity question by determining the transitive closure of , which can be done most easily by keeping our relation in matrix form. is significant in our calculations because it tells us that we need only go as far as to determine the matrix of the transitive closure.    The main advantage of the adjacency matrix method is that the transitive closure matrix can answer all questions about the existence of paths between any vertices. If is the matrix of the transitive closure, is connected to if and only if . A directed graph is connected if or for each . A directed graph is strongly connected if its transitive closure matrix has no zeros.  A disadvantage of the adjacency matrix method is that the transitive closure matrix tells us whether a path exists, but not what the path is. The next algorithm will solve this problem.   Breadth-First Search Breadth-First Search  We will describe the Breadth-First Search Algorithm first with an example.  The football team at Mediocre State University (MSU) has had a bad year, 2 wins and 9 losses. Thirty days after the end of the football season, the university trustees are meeting to decide whether to rehire the head coach; things look bad for him. However, on the day of the meeting, the coach issues the following press release with results from the past year:  Press Release: MSU completes successful season  The Mediocre State University football team compared favorably with national champion Enormous State University this season.   Mediocre State defeated Local A and M.  Local A and M defeated City College.  City College defeated Corn State U.  ... (25 results later)  Tough Tech defeated Enormous State University (ESU).   ...and ESU went on to win the national championship!   The trustees were so impressed that they rehired the coach with a raise! How did the coach come up with such a list?  In reality, such lists exist occasionally and have appeared in newspapers from time to time. Of course they really don't prove anything since each team that defeated MSU in our example above can produce a similar, shorter chain of results. Since college football records are readily available, the coach could have found this list by trial and error. All that he needed to start with was that his team won at least one game. Since ESU lost one game, there was some hope of producing the chain.  The problem of finding this list is equivalent to finding a path in the tournament graph for last year's football season that initiates at MSU and ends at ESU. Such a graph is far from complete and is likely to be represented using edge lists. To make the coach's problem interesting, let's imagine that only the winner of any game remembers the result of the game. The coach's problem has now taken on the flavor of a maze. To reach ESU, he must communicate with the various teams along the path. One way that the coach could have discovered his list in time is by sending the following messages to the coaches of the two teams that MSU defeated during the season:  When this example was first written, we commented that ties should be ignored. Most recent NCAA rules call for a tiebreaker in college football and so ties are no longer an issue. Email was also not common and we described the process in terms of letters, not email messages. Another change is that the coach could also have asked the MSU math department to use Mathematica or Sage to find the path!  The Coach's Letter  Dear Football Coach:  Please follow these directions exactly.   If you are the coach at ESU, contact the coach at MSU now and tell him who sent you this message.  If you are not the coach at ESU and this is the first message of this type that you have received, then:   Remember from whom you received this message.  Forward a copy of this message, signed by you, to each of the coaches whose teams you defeated during the past year.  Ignore this message if you have received one like it already.    Signed,  Coach of MSU    Observations  From the conditions of this message, it should be clear that if everyone cooperates and if coaches participate within a day of receiving the message:   If a path of length exists from MSU to ESU, then the coach will know about it in days.  By making a series of phone calls, the coach can construct a path that he wants by first calling the coach who defeated ESU (the person who sent ESU's coach that message). This coach will know who sent him a letter, and so on. Therefore, the vertex list of the desired path is constructed in reverse order.  If a total of football games were played, no more than messages will be sent out.  If a day passes without any message being sent out, no path from MSU to ESU exists.  This method could be extended to construct a list of all teams that a given team can be connected to. Simply imagine a series of letters like the one above sent by each football coach and targeted at every other coach.    The general problem of finding a path between two vertices in a graph, if one exists, can be solved exactly as we solved the problem above. The following algorithm, commonly called a breadth-first search, uses a stack.   Stacks Stack A stack is a fundamental data structure in computer science. A common analogy used to describe stacks is a stack of plates. If you put a plate on the top of a stack and then want to use a plate, it's natural to use that top plate. So the last plate in is the first plate out. Last in, first out is the short description of the rule for stacks. This is contrast with a queue which uses a First in, first out rule.   Breadth-first Search  Breadth-first Search  A broadcasting algorithm for finding a path between vertex and vertex of a graph having vertices. Each item of a list , consists of a Boolean field and an integer field . The sets , , called depth sets, have the property that if , then the shortest path from vertex to vertex is of length . In Step 5, a stack is used to put the vertex list for the path from the vertex to vertex in the proper order. That stack is the output of the algorithm.   Set the value equal to False,     while ) and   for each k in :  for each edge (k,t):  If == False:       if :    while :  Push onto    Push onto  Push onto       Notes on Breadth-first Search   This algorithm will produce one path from vertex to vertex , if one exists, and that path will be as short as possible. If more than one path of this length exists, then the one that is produced depends on the order in which the edges are examined and the order in which the elements of are examined in Step 4.  The condition is analogous to the condition that no mail is sent in a given stage of the process, in which case MSU cannot be connected to ESU.  This algorithm can be easily revised to find paths to all vertices that can be reached from vertex . Step 5 would be put off until a specific path to a vertex is needed since the information in contains an efficient list of all paths. The algorithm can also be extended further to find paths between any two vertices.    A simple example  Consider the graph below. The existence of a path from vertex 2 to vertex 3 is not difficult to determine by examination. After a few seconds, you should be able to find two paths of length four. will produce one of them.   A simple example of breadth-first search   Example Graph for breadth-first search    Suppose that the edges from each vertex are sorted in ascending order by terminal vertex. For example, the edges from vertex 3 would be in the order . In addition, assume that in the body of Step 4 of the algorithm, the elements of are used in ascending order. Then at the end of Step 4, the value of will be Therefore, the path is produced by the algorithm. Note that if we wanted a path from 2 to 5, the information in produces the path (2, 1, 5) since and . A shortest circuit that initiates at vertex 2 is also available by noting that , , and ; thus the circuit is the output of the algorithm.   Graph Measurements  If we were to perform a breadth first search from each vertex in a graph, we could proceed to determine several key measurements relating to the general connectivity of that graph. From each vertex , the distance from to any other vertex , , is number of edges in the shortest path from to . This number is also the index of the depth set to which belongs in a breath-first search starting at . where is the family of depth sets starting at .  If the vector of from-values is known from the breath-first search, then the distance can be determined recursively as follows:    Computing Distances   Graph Measurements Example   An undirected graph with 12 vertices having dictionary representation {1:[6,7,10],2:[7,9,12],3:[10],4:[6,8,10],5:[9,11],6:[7,11],7:[10,12],9:[11]}    Consider . If we perform a breadth first search of this graph starting at vertex 2, for example, we get the following from data telling us from what vertex each vertex is reached. For example, 4.from has a value of 6. We can compute :    Once we know distances between any two vertices, we can determine the eccentricity of each vertex; and the graph's diameter, radius and center. First, we define these terms precisely.   The eccentricity of a vertex  The diameter of graph The radius of graph The center of graph   Eccentricity of a Vertex Eccentricity of a vertex  The maximum distance from a vertex to all other vertices, .    Diameter of a Graph Diameter of a Graph  The maximum eccentricity of vertices in a graph, denoted .    Radius of a Graph Radius of a graph  The minimum eccentricity of vertices in a graph, denoted .    Center of a Graph Center of a graph  The set of vertices with minimal eccentricity,    Measurements from distance matrices  If we compute all distances between vertices, we can summarize the results in a distance matrix, where the entry in row , column is the distance from vertex to vertex . For the graph in , that matrix is If we scan the matrix, we can see that the maximum distance is the distance between vertices 3 and 5, which is 5 and is the diameter of the graph. If we focus on individual rows and identify the maximum values, which are the eccentricities, their minimum is 3, which the graph's radius. This eccentricity value is attained by vertices in the set , which is the center of the graph.    SageMath Note - Graph Searching SageMath Note Search in a Graph  The following sequence of Sage cells illustrates how searching can be done in graphs.  Generate a random undirected graph with 18 vertices. For each pair of vertices, an edge is included between them with probability 0.2. Since there are potential edges, we expect that there will be approximately edges. The random number generation is seeded first so that the result will always be the same in spite of the random graph function. Changing or removing that first line will let you experiment with different graphs.   Count the number of edges. In this case the number is a bit less than expected.   Find a shortest path from vertex 0 to vertex 8.   Generate a list of vertices that would be reached in a breadth-first search. The expression Gr.breadth_first_search(0) creates an iterator that is convenient for programming. Wrapping list( ) around the expression shows the order in which the vertices are visited with the depth set indicated in the second coordinates.     Exercises  Apply to find a path from 5 to 1 in . What would be the final value of ? Assume that the terminal vertices in edge lists and elements of the depth sets are put into ascending order, as we assumed in .      Apply to find a path from to in the road graph in using the edge list in that example. Assume that the elements of the depth sets are put into ascending order.  In a simple undirected graph with no self-loops, what is the maximum number of edges you can have, keeping the graph unconnected? What is the minimum number of edges that will assure that the graph is connected? If the number of vertices is , there can be vertices with one vertex not connected to any of the others. One more edge and connectivity is assured.   Use a broadcasting algorithm to determine the shortest path from vertex to vertex in the graphs shown in the below. List the depth sets and the stack that is created.   Shortest paths from to ?   Graphs for exercise 9-3-4      For each of the following graphs, determine the eccentricities of each vertex, and the diameter, radius, and center of the graph.    An undirected graph with 6 vertices.    An undirected graph with 6 vertices.      An undirected graph with 6 vertices.    An undirected graph with 6 vertices.      The eccentricity of each vertex is 2; and the diameter and radius are both 2 as well. All vertices are part of the center.  The corners (1,3,10 and 10) have eccentricities 5. The two central vertices, 5 and 8, which are in the center of the graph have eccentricity 3. All other vertices have eccentricity 4. The diameter is 5. The radius is 3.  Vertices 1, 2 and 5 have eccentricity 2 and make up the center of this graph. Verticies 7 and 8 have eccentricity 4, and all other vertices have eccentricity 3. The diameter is 4. The radius is 2.  The eccentricity of each vertex is 4; and the diameter and radius are both 4 as well. All vertices are part of the center.       The terms diameter, radius and center are familiar ones in the context of circles. Compare their usage in circles and graphs. How are they similar and how are they different?  Eccentricity might be less familiar. How is is used in geometry, and does it have a compatible use in graph theory?    Prove (by induction on ) that if the relation on vertices of a graph is defined by if there is an edge connecting to , then , , is defined by if there is a path of length from to .  Basis: Is the relation , defined by if there is a path of length 1 from ? Yes, since if and only if an edge, which is a path of length , connects to .

By the induction hypothesis, there is a path of length from . And by the basis, there is a path of length one from to . If we combine these two paths, we obtain a path of length from to . Of course, if we start with a path of length from to , we have a path of length from to some vertex and a path of length 1 from to . Therefore, .

This coach will know who sent him a letter, and so on. Therefore, the vertex list of the desired path is constructed in reverse order.  If a total of football games were played, no more than messages will be sent out.  If a day passes without any message being sent out, no path from MSU to ESU exists.

  "title": "Traversals: Eulerian and Hamiltonian Graphs",
  "body": " Traversals: Eulerian and Hamiltonian Graphs  Traversals of Graphs  The subject of graph traversals has a long history. In fact, the solution by Leonhard Euler (Switzerland, 1707-83) of the Koenigsberg Bridge Problem is considered by many to represent the birth of graph theory.   Eulerian Graphs    A map of Koenigsberg, circa 1735   A map of Koenigsberg     A multigraph for the bridges of Koenigsberg     A map of the Prussian city of Koenigsberg (circa 1735) in shows that there were seven bridges connecting the four land masses that made up the city. The legend of this problem states that the citizens of Koenigsberg searched in vain for a walking tour that passed over each bridge exactly once. No one could design such a tour and the search was abruptly abandoned with the publication of Euler's Theorem.  Euler's Theorem: Koenigsberg Case Euler's Theorem Koenigsberg Case  No walking tour of Koenigsberg can be designed so that each bridge is used exactly once.  The map of Koenigsberg can be represented as an undirected multigraph, as in . The four land masses are the vertices and each edge represents a bridge.  The desired tour is then a path that uses each edge once and only once. Since the path can start and end at two different vertices, there are two remaining vertices that must be intermediate vertices in the path. If is an intermediate vertex, then every time that you visit , you must use two of its incident edges, one to enter and one to exit. Therefore, there must be an even number of edges connecting to the other vertices. Since every vertex in the Koenigsberg graph has an odd number of edges, no tour of the type that is desired is possible.    As is typical of most mathematicians, Euler wasn't satisfied with solving only the Koenigsberg problem. His original theorem, which is paraphrased below, concerned the existence of paths and circuits like those sought in Koenigsberg. These paths and circuits have become associated with Euler's name.  Eulerian Paths, Circuits, Graphs Eulerian Paths, Circuits, Graphs An Eulerian path through a graph is a path whose edge list contains each edge of the graph exactly once. If the path is a circuit, then it is called an Eulerian circuit. An Eulerian graph is a graph that possesses an Eulerian circuit.  Notice that if a graph has an Eulerian path that is not a circuit it is generally not considered an Eulerian graph, although some authors will call it such. So in any reference you read, be sure to check that definition that is used!  An Eulerian Graph Without tracing any paths, we can be sure that the graph below has an Eulerian circuit because all vertices have an even degree. This follows from the following theorem.   An Eulerian graph   An Eulerian graph     Euler's Theorem: General Case  Euler's Theorem  An undirected graph has an Eulerian path if and only if it is connected and has either zero or two vertices with an odd degree. If no vertex has an odd degree, then the graph is Eulerian.  It can be proven by induction that the number of vertices in an undirected graph that have an odd degree must be even. We will leave the proof of this fact to the reader as an exercise. The necessity of having either zero or two vertices of odd degree is clear from the proof of the Koenigsberg case of this theorem. Therefore, we will concentrate on proving that this condition is sufficient to ensure that a graph has an Eulerian path. Let be the number of vertices with odd degree.  Phase 1. If , start at any vertex, , and travel along any path, not using any edge twice. Since each vertex has an even degree, this path can always be continued past each vertex that you reach except . The result is a circuit that includes . If , let be either one of the vertices of odd degree. Trace any path starting at using up edges until you can go no further, as in the case. This time, the path that you obtain must end at the other vertex of odd degree that we will call . At the end of Phase 1, we have an initial path that may or may not be Eulerian. If it is not Eulerian, Phase 2 can be repeated until all of the edges have been used. Since the number of unused edges is decreased in any use of Phase 2, an Eulerian path must be obtained in a finite number of steps.  Phase 2. As we enter this phase, we have constructed a path that uses a proper subset of the edges in our graph. We will refer to this path as the current path. Let be the vertices of our graph, the edges, and the edges that have been used in the current path. Consider the graph . Note that every vertex in has an even degree. Select any edge, , from Let and be the vertices that connects. Trace a new path starting at whose first edge is . We can be sure that at least one vertex of the new path is also in the current path since is connected. Starting at , there exists a path in to any vertex in the current path. At some point along this path, which we can consider the start of the new path, we will have intersected the current path. Since the degree of each vertex in is even, any path that we start at can be continued until it is a circuit. Now, we simply augment the current path with this circuit. As we travel along the current path, the first time that we intersect the new path, we travel along it (see ). Once we complete the circuit that is the new path, we resume the traversal of the current path.   Path Augmentation Plan   Path Augmentation Plan    If the result of this phase is an Eulerian path, then we are finished; otherwise, repeat this phase.   Complete Eulerian Graphs The complete undirected graphs , . .., are Eulerian. If , then is not Eulerian.   Hamiltonian Graphs  To search for a path that uses every vertex of a graph exactly once seems to be a natural next problem after you have considered Eulerian graphs.The Irish mathematician Sir William Rowan Hamilton (1805-65) is given credit for first defining such paths. He is also credited with discovering the quaternions, for which he was honored by the Irish government with a postage stamp in 2005.   Irish stamp honoring Sir William Rowan Hamilton   Irish stamp honoring Sir William Rowan Hamilton    Hamiltonian Path, Circuit, and Graphs Hamiltonian Paths, Circuits, and Graphs  A Hamiltonian path through a graph is a path whose vertex list contains each vertex of the graph exactly once, except if the path is a circuit, in which case the initial vertex appears a second time as the terminal vertex. If the path is a circuit, then it is called a Hamiltonian circuit. A Hamiltonian graph is a graph that possesses a Hamiltonian circuit.  The Original Hamiltonian Graph shows a graph that is Hamiltonian. In fact, it is the graph that Hamilton used as an example to pose the question of existence of Hamiltonian paths in 1859. In its original form, the puzzle that was posed to readers was called Around the World. The vertices were labeled with names of major cities of the world and the object was to complete a tour of these cities. The graph is also referred to as the dodecahedron graph, where vertices correspond with the corners of a dodecahedron and the edges are the edges of the solid that connect the corners.    A Dodecahedron   A Dodecahedron     The Dodecahedron Graph   The Dodecahedron Graph      Unfortunately, a simple condition doesn't exist that characterizes a Hamiltonian graph. An obvious necessary condition is that the graph be connected; however, there is a connected undirected graph with four vertices that is not Hamiltonian. Can you draw such a graph?  What Is Possible and What Is Impossible? The search for a Hamiltonian path in a graph is typical of many simple-sounding problems in graph theory that have proven to be very difficult to solve. Although there are simple algorithms for conducting the search, they are impractical for large problems because they take such a long time to complete as graph size increases. Currently, every algorithm to search for a Hamiltonian path in a graph takes a time that grows at a rate that is greater than any polynomial as a function of the number of vertices. Rates of this type are called super-polynomial . That is, if is the time it takes to search a graph of vertices, and is any polynomial, then for all but possibly a finite number of positive values for .  It is an unproven but widely held belief that no faster algorithm exists to search for Hamiltonian paths in general graphs. To sum up, the problem of determining whether a graph is Hamiltonian is theoretically possible; however, for large graphs we consider it a practical impossibility. Many of the problems we will discuss in the next section, particularly the Traveling Salesman Problem, are thought to be impossible in the same sense.  The -cube  N-cube the -cube Let , and let be the set of strings of 0's and 1's with length . The -cube is the undirected graph with a vertex for each string in and an edge connecting each pair of strings that differ in exactly one position. The -cube is normally denoted .  The -cube is among the graphs that are defined within the graphs package of SageMath and is created with the expression graphs.CubeGraph(n) .   Analog-to-digital Conversion and the Gray Code  Analog-to-digital Conversion  Gray Code  A common problem encountered in engineering is that of analog-to-digital (a-d) conversion, where the reading on a dial, for example, must be converted to a numerical value. In order for this conversion to be done reliably and quickly, one must solve an interesting problem in graph theory. Before this problem is posed, we will make the connection between a-d conversion and the graph problem using a simple example. Suppose a dial can be turned in any direction, and that the positions will be converted to one of the numbers zero through seven as depicted in . The angles from 0 to 360 are divided into eight equal parts, and each part is assigned a number starting with 0 and increasing clockwise. If the dial points in any of these sectors the conversion is to the number of that sector. If the dial is on the boundary, then we will be satisfied with the conversion to either of the numbers in the bordering sectors. This conversion can be thought of as giving an approximate angle of the dial, for if the dial is in sector , then the angle that the dial makes with east is approximately .   Analog-Digital Dial   Analog-Digital Dial    Now that the desired conversion has been identified, we will describe a solution that has one major error in it, and then identify how this problem can be rectified. All digital computers represent numbers in binary form, as a sequence of 0's and 1's called bits, short for binary digits. The binary representations of numbers 0 through 7 are:   The way that we could send those bits to a computer is by coating parts of the back of the dial with a metallic substance, as in . For each of the three concentric circles on the dial there is a small magnet. If a magnet lies under a part of the dial that has been coated with metal, then it will turn a switch ON, whereas the switch stays OFF when no metal is detected above a magnet. Notice how every ON\/OFF combination of the three switches is possible given the way the back of the dial is coated.  If the dial is placed so that the magnets are in the middle of a sector, we expect this method to work well. There is a problem on certain boundaries, however. If the dial is turned so that the magnets are between sectors three and four, for example, then it is unclear what the result will be. This is due to the fact that each magnet will have only a fraction of the required metal above it to turn its switch ON. Due to expected irregularities in the coating of the dial, we can be safe in saying that for each switch either ON or OFF could be the result, and so if the dial is between sectors three and four, any number could be indicated. This problem does not occur between every sector. For example, between sectors 0 and 1, there is only one switch that cannot be predicted. No matter what the outcome is for the units switch in this case, the indicated sector must be either 0 or 1. This consistent with the original objective that a positioning of the dial on a boundary of two sectors should produce the number of either sector.   Coating scheme for the Analog-Digital Dial   Analog-Digital Dial    Is there a way to coat the sectors on the back of the dial so that each of the eight patterns corresponding to the numbers 0 to 7 appears once, and so that between any two adjacent sectors there is only one switch that will have a questionable setting? What we are describing here is a Hamiltonian circuit of the -cube ( ). If one can draw a path along the edges in the 3-cube that starts at any vertex, passes through every other vertex once, and returns to the start, then that sequence of bit patterns can be used to coat the back of the dial so that between every sector there is only one questionable switch. Such a path is not difficult to find, as we will see below.   The 3-cube   The 3-cube    Many A-D conversion problems require many more sectors and switches than this example, and the same kinds of problems can occur. The solution would be to find a path within a much larger yet similar graph. For example, there might be 1,024 sectors with 10 switches, resulting in a graph with 1,024 vertices. Fortunately, our solution will apply to the -cube for any positive value of .  A Hamiltonian circuit of the -cube can be described recursively. The circuit itself, called the Gray Code, is not the only Hamiltonian circuit of the -cube, but it is the easiest to describe. The standard way to write the Gray Code is as a column of strings, where the last string is followed by the first string to complete the circuit.  Basis for the Gray Code ( ): The Gray Code for the 1-cube is . Note that the edge between 0 and 1 is used twice in this circuit. That doesn't violate any rules for Hamiltonian circuits, but can only happen if a graph has two vertices.  Recursive definition of the Gray Code: Given the Gray Code for the -cube, , then is obtained by (1) listing with each string prefixed with 0, and then (2) reversing the list of strings in with each string prefixed with 1. Symbolically, the recursion can be expressed as follows, where is the reverse of list .   The Gray Codes for the 2-cube and 3-cube are   One question might come to mind at this point. If the coatings of the dial no longer in the sequence from 0 to 7, how would you interpret the patterns that are on the back of the dial as numbers from 0 to 7? In Chapter 14 we will see that if the Gray Code is used, this decoding is quite easy.   Applications of the Gray Code One application of the Gray code was discussed in the Introduction to this book. Another application is in statistics. In a statistical analysis, there is often a variable that depends on several factors, but exactly which factors are significant may not be obvious. For each subset of factors, there would be certain quantities to be calculated. One such quantity is the multiple correlation coefficient for a subset. If the correlation coefficient for a given subset, , is known, then the value for any subset that is obtained by either deleting or adding an element to can be obtained quickly. To calculate the correlation coefficient for each set, we simply travel along , where is the number of factors being studied. The first vertex will always be the string of 0's, which represents the empty set. For each vertex that you visit, the set that it corresponds to contains the factor if the character is a 1.   The 3-cube and its generalization, the -cube, play a role in the design of a multiprocessor called a hypercube. A multiprocessor is a computer that consists of several independent processors that can operate simultaneously and are connected to one another by a network of connections. In a hypercube with processors, the processors are numbered 0 to . Two processors are connected if their binary representations differ in exactly one bit. The hypercube has proven to be the best possible network for certain problems requiring the use of a supercomputer.    Exercises  Locate a map of New York City and draw a graph that represents its land masses, bridges and tunnels. Is there an Eulerian path through New York? You can do the same with any other city that has at least two land masses. Using a recent road map, it appears that an Eulerian circuit exists in New York City, not including the small islands that belong to the city. Lowell, Massachusetts, is located at the confluence of the Merrimack and Concord rivers and has several canals flowing through it. No Eulerian path exists for Lowell.

Can this be done, and if so, where should the bridge be built? Any bridge between two land masses will be sufficient. To get an Eulerian circuit, you must add a second bridge that connects the two land masses that were not connected by the first bridge.  Consider the graphs in .

Therefore, there must be an even number of edges connecting to the other vertices.

  "body": "Euler's Theorem: General Case  Euler's Theorem  An undirected graph has an Eulerian path if and only if it is connected and has either zero or two vertices with an odd degree. If no vertex has an odd degree, then the graph is Eulerian.  It can be proven by induction that the number of vertices in an undirected graph that have an odd degree must be even. We will leave the proof of this fact to the reader as an exercise. The necessity of having either zero or two vertices of odd degree is clear from the proof of the Koenigsberg case of this theorem. Therefore, we will concentrate on proving that this condition is sufficient to ensure that a graph has an Eulerian path. Let be the number of vertices with odd degree.  Phase 1. If , start at any vertex, , and travel along any path, not using any edge twice. Since each vertex has an even degree, this path can always be continued past each vertex that you reach except . The result is a circuit that includes . If , let be either one of the vertices of odd degree. Trace any path starting at using up edges until you can go no further, as in the case. This time, the path that you obtain must end at the other vertex of odd degree that we will call . At the end of Phase 1, we have an initial path that may or may not be Eulerian. If it is not Eulerian, Phase 2 can be repeated until all of the edges have been used. Since the number of unused edges is decreased in any use of Phase 2, an Eulerian path must be obtained in a finite number of steps.  Phase 2. As we enter this phase, we have constructed a path that uses a proper subset of the edges in our graph. We will refer to this path as the current path. Let be the vertices of our graph, the edges, and the edges that have been used in the current path. Consider the graph . Note that every vertex in has an even degree. Select any edge, , from Let and be the vertices that connects. Trace a new path starting at whose first edge is . We can be sure that at least one vertex of the new path is also in the current path since is connected. Starting at , there exists a path in to any vertex in the current path. At some point along this path, which we can consider the start of the new path, we will have intersected the current path. Since the degree of each vertex in is even, any path that we start at can be continued until it is a circuit. Now, we simply augment the current path with this circuit. As we travel along the current path, the first time that we intersect the new path, we travel along it (see ). Once we complete the circuit that is the new path, we resume the traversal of the current path.

The search for a Hamiltonian path in a graph is typical of many simple-sounding problems in graph theory that have proven to be very difficult to solve. Although there are simple algorithms for conducting the search, they are impractical for large problems because they take such a long time to complete as graph size increases. Currently, every algorithm to search for a Hamiltonian path in a graph takes a time that grows at a rate that is greater than any polynomial as a function of the number of vertices. Rates of this type are called super-polynomial . That is, if is the time it takes to search a graph of vertices, and is any polynomial, then for all but possibly a finite number of positive values for .  It is an unproven but widely held belief that no faster algorithm exists to search for Hamiltonian paths in general graphs. To sum up, the problem of determining whether a graph is Hamiltonian is theoretically possible; however, for large graphs we consider it a practical impossibility. Many of the problems we will discuss in the next section, particularly the Traveling Salesman Problem, are thought to be impossible in the same sense. "

  "title": "Analog-to-digital Conversion and the Gray Code.",
  "body": "Analog-to-digital Conversion and the Gray Code  Analog-to-digital Conversion  Gray Code  A common problem encountered in engineering is that of analog-to-digital (a-d) conversion, where the reading on a dial, for example, must be converted to a numerical value. In order for this conversion to be done reliably and quickly, one must solve an interesting problem in graph theory. Before this problem is posed, we will make the connection between a-d conversion and the graph problem using a simple example. Suppose a dial can be turned in any direction, and that the positions will be converted to one of the numbers zero through seven as depicted in . The angles from 0 to 360 are divided into eight equal parts, and each part is assigned a number starting with 0 and increasing clockwise. If the dial points in any of these sectors the conversion is to the number of that sector. If the dial is on the boundary, then we will be satisfied with the conversion to either of the numbers in the bordering sectors. This conversion can be thought of as giving an approximate angle of the dial, for if the dial is in sector , then the angle that the dial makes with east is approximately .   Analog-Digital Dial   Analog-Digital Dial    Now that the desired conversion has been identified, we will describe a solution that has one major error in it, and then identify how this problem can be rectified. All digital computers represent numbers in binary form, as a sequence of 0's and 1's called bits, short for binary digits. The binary representations of numbers 0 through 7 are:   The way that we could send those bits to a computer is by coating parts of the back of the dial with a metallic substance, as in . For each of the three concentric circles on the dial there is a small magnet. If a magnet lies under a part of the dial that has been coated with metal, then it will turn a switch ON, whereas the switch stays OFF when no metal is detected above a magnet. Notice how every ON\/OFF combination of the three switches is possible given the way the back of the dial is coated.  If the dial is placed so that the magnets are in the middle of a sector, we expect this method to work well. There is a problem on certain boundaries, however. If the dial is turned so that the magnets are between sectors three and four, for example, then it is unclear what the result will be. This is due to the fact that each magnet will have only a fraction of the required metal above it to turn its switch ON. Due to expected irregularities in the coating of the dial, we can be safe in saying that for each switch either ON or OFF could be the result, and so if the dial is between sectors three and four, any number could be indicated. This problem does not occur between every sector. For example, between sectors 0 and 1, there is only one switch that cannot be predicted. No matter what the outcome is for the units switch in this case, the indicated sector must be either 0 or 1. This consistent with the original objective that a positioning of the dial on a boundary of two sectors should produce the number of either sector.   Coating scheme for the Analog-Digital Dial   Analog-Digital Dial    Is there a way to coat the sectors on the back of the dial so that each of the eight patterns corresponding to the numbers 0 to 7 appears once, and so that between any two adjacent sectors there is only one switch that will have a questionable setting? What we are describing here is a Hamiltonian circuit of the -cube ( ). If one can draw a path along the edges in the 3-cube that starts at any vertex, passes through every other vertex once, and returns to the start, then that sequence of bit patterns can be used to coat the back of the dial so that between every sector there is only one questionable switch. Such a path is not difficult to find, as we will see below.   The 3-cube   The 3-cube    Many A-D conversion problems require many more sectors and switches than this example, and the same kinds of problems can occur. The solution would be to find a path within a much larger yet similar graph. For example, there might be 1,024 sectors with 10 switches, resulting in a graph with 1,024 vertices. Fortunately, our solution will apply to the -cube for any positive value of .  A Hamiltonian circuit of the -cube can be described recursively. The circuit itself, called the Gray Code, is not the only Hamiltonian circuit of the -cube, but it is the easiest to describe. The standard way to write the Gray Code is as a column of strings, where the last string is followed by the first string to complete the circuit.  Basis for the Gray Code ( ): The Gray Code for the 1-cube is . Note that the edge between 0 and 1 is used twice in this circuit. That doesn't violate any rules for Hamiltonian circuits, but can only happen if a graph has two vertices.  Recursive definition of the Gray Code: Given the Gray Code for the -cube, , then is obtained by (1) listing with each string prefixed with 0, and then (2) reversing the list of strings in with each string prefixed with 1. Symbolically, the recursion can be expressed as follows, where is the reverse of list .   The Gray Codes for the 2-cube and 3-cube are   One question might come to mind at this point. If the coatings of the dial no longer in the sequence from 0 to 7, how would you interpret the patterns that are on the back of the dial as numbers from 0 to 7? In Chapter 14 we will see that if the Gray Code is used, this decoding is quite easy.  "

We will concentrate most of our attention on two of these problems, the Traveling Salesman Problem and the Maximum Flow Problem. At the close of this section, we will discuss some other common optimization problems.   Weighted Graphs  Weighted Graph Weighted Graph A weighted graph, , is a graph together with a weight function . If , is the weight on edge .  As you will see in our examples, is often a cost associated with the edge ; therefore, most weights will be positive.  A Distance Graph Let be the set of six capital cities in New England: Boston, Augusta, Hartford, Providence, Concord, and Montpelier. Let be ; that is, is a complete unordered graph. An example of a weight function on this graph is .  Many road maps define distance functions as in the following table.

Any such circuit is called an optimal path.  Some statements of the Traveling Salesman Problem require that the circuit be Hamiltonian. In many applications, the graph in question will be complete and this restriction presents no problem. If the weight on each edge is constant, for example, , then an optimal path would be any Hamiltonian circuit.  The problem of a Boston salesman The Traveling Salesman Problem gets its name from the situation of a salesman who wants to minimize the number of miles that he travels in visiting his customers. For example, if a salesman from Boston must visit the other capital cities of New England, then the problem is to find a circuit in the weighted graph of . Note that distance and cost are clearly related in this case. In addition, tolls and traffic congestion might also be taken into account.  The search for an efficient algorithm that solves the Traveling Salesman has occupied researchers for years. If the graph in question is complete, there are different circuits. As gets large, it is impossible to check every possible circuit. The most efficient algorithms for solving the Traveling Salesman Problem take an amount of time that is proportional to . Since this quantity grows so quickly, we can't expect to have the time to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem for large values of . Most of the useful algorithms that have been developed have to be heuristic; that is, they find a circuit that should be close to the optimal one. One such algorithm is the closest neighbor algorithm, one of the earliest attempts at solving the Traveling Salesman Problem. The general idea behind this algorithm is, starting at any vertex, to visit the closest neighbor to the starting point. At each vertex, the next vertex that is visited is the closest one that has not been reached. This shortsighted approach typifies heuristic algorithms called greedy algorithms, which attempt to solve a minimization (maximization) problem by minimizing (maximizing) the quantity associated with only the first step.  The Closest Neighbor Algorithm Closest Neighbor Algorithm  Let be a complete weighted graph with . The closest neighbor circuit through G starting at is , defined by the steps:    .  For to     the closest vertex in to  ##  ## In case of a tie for closest, may be chosen arbitrarily.     the only element of   The cost of the closest neighbor circuit is    A small example The closest neighbor circuit starting at 1 in is , with a cost of 29. The optimal path is , with a cost of 27.   A small example   A small weighted graph     Although the closest neighbor circuit is often not optimal, we may be satisfied if it is close to optimal. If and are the costs of optimal and closest neighbor circuits in a graph, then it is always the case that or . We can assess how good the closest neighbor algorithm is by determining how small the quantity gets. If it is always near 1, then the algorithm is good. However, if there are graphs for which it is large, then the algorithm may be discarded. Note that in , . A 7 percent increase in cost may or may not be considered significant, depending on the situation.  The One-way Street A salesman must make stops at vertices A, B, and C, which are all on the same one-way street. The graph in is weighted by the function equal to the time it takes to drive from vertex to vertex .   Traveling a one-way street   A small directed weighted graph    Note that if is down the one-way street from , then . The values of , and are 20 and 32, respectively. Verify that is 32 by using the closest neighbor algorithm. The value of is significant in this case since our salesman would spend 60 percent more time on the road if he used the closest neighbor algorithm.   A more general result relating to the closest neighbor algorithm presumes that the graph in question is complete and that the weight function satisfies the conditions    for all , in the vertex set, and   for all , , in the vertex set.   The first condition is called the symmetry condition and the second is the triangle inequality.  If is a complete weighted graph that satisfies the symmetry and triangle inequality conditions, then   If , then this theorem says that can be no larger than twice the size of ; however, it doesn't say that the closest neighbor circuit will necessarily be that far from an optimal circuit. The quantity is called an upper bound for the ratio . It tells us only that things can't be any worse than the upper bound. Certainly, there are many graphs with eight vertices such that the optimal and closest neighbor circuits are the same. What is left unstated in this theorem is whether there are graphs for which the quantities are equal. If there are such graphs, we say that the upper bound is sharp.  The value of in Example is 1.6, which is greater than ; however, the weight function in this example does not satisfy the conditions of the theorem.   The Unit Square Problem Suppose a robot is programmed to weld joints on square metal plates. Each plate must be welded at prescribed points on the square. To minimize the time it takes to complete the job, the total distance that a robot's arm moves should be minimized. Let be the distance between and . Assume that before each plate can be welded, the arm must be positioned at a certain point . Given a list of points, we want to put them in order so that is as small as possible.  The type of problem that is outlined in the example above is of such importance that it is one of the most studied version of the Traveling Salesman Problem. What follows is the usual statement of the problem. Let , and let , the unit square. Given pairs of real numbers in that represent the vertices of a , find a circuit of the graph that minimizes the sum of the distances traveled in traversing the circuit.  Since the problem calls for a circuit, it doesn't matter which vertex we start at; assume that we will start at . Once the problem is solved, we can always change our starting position. A function can most efficiently describe a circuit in this problem. Every bijection with describes a circuit There are such bijections. Since a circuit and its reversal have the same associated cost, there are cases to consider. An examination of all possible cases is not feasible for large values of .  One popular heuristic algorithm is the strip algorithm:  The Strip Algorithm  Given points in the unit square:  Phase 1:  Divide the square into vertical strips, as in . Let d be the width of each strip. If a point lies on a boundary between two strips, consider it part of the left-hand strip.  Starting from the left, find the first strip that contains one of the points. Locate the starting point by selecting the first point that is encountered in that strip as you travel from bottom to top. We will assume that the first point is  Alternate traveling up and down the strips that contain vertices until all of the vertices have been reached.  Return to the starting point.   Phase 2:  Shift all strips units to the right (creating a small strip on the left).  Repeat Steps 1.2 through 1.4 of Phase 1 with the new strips.   When the two phases are complete, choose the shorter of the two circuits obtained.     The Strip Algorithm   The Strip Algorithm    Step may need a bit more explanation. How do you travel up or down a strip? In most cases, the vertices in a strip will be vertically distributed so that the order in which they are visited is obvious. In some cases, however, the order might not be clear, as in the third strip in Phase I of . Within a strip, the order in which you visit the points (if you are going up the strip) is determined thusly: precedes if or if and . In traveling down a strip, replace with .  The selection of strips was made in a 1959 paper by Beardwood, Halton, and Hammersley. It balances the problems that arise if the number of strips is too small or too large. If the square is divided into too few strips, some strips may be packed with vertices so that visiting them would require excessive horizontal motion. If too many strips are used, excessive vertical motion tends to be the result. An update on what is known about this algorithm is contained in .  Since the construction of a circuit in the square consists of sorting the given points, it should come as no surprise that the strip algorithm requires a time that is roughly a multiple of time units when points are to be visited.  The worst case that has been encountered with this algorithm is one in which the circuit obtained has a total distance of approximately (see Sopowit et al.).   Networks and the Maximum Flow Problem Networks  Network Network  A network is a simple weighted directed graph that contains two distinguished vertices called the source and the sink with the properties that the indegree of the source and outdegree of the sink are both zero, and source is connected to sink. The weight function on a network is the capacity function, which has positive weights.  An example of a real situation that can be represented by a network is a city's water system. A reservoir would be the source, while a distribution point in the city to all of the users would be the sink. The system of pumps and pipes that carries the water from source to sink makes up the remaining network. We can assume that the water that passes through a pipe in one minute is controlled by a pump and the maximum rate is determined by the size of the pipe and the strength of the pump. This maximum rate of flow through a pipe is called its capacity and is the information that the weight function of a network contains.  A City Water System Consider the system that is illustrated in . The numbers that appear next to each pipe indicate the capacity of that pipe in thousands of gallons per minute. This map can be drawn in the form of a network, as in .   City Water System   City Water System     Flow Diagram for a City's Water Network   City Water Network    Although the material passing through this network is water, networks can also represent the flow of other materials, such as automobiles, electricity, bits, telephone calls, or patients in a health system.   The Maximum Flow Problem  The Maximum Flow Problem is derived from the objective of moving the maximum amount of water or other material from the source to the sink. To measure this amount, we define a flow as a function such that (1) the flow of material through any edge is nonnegative and no larger than its capacity: , for all ; and (2) for each vertex other than the source and sink, the total amount of material that is directed into a vertex is equal to the total amount that is directed out: The summation on the left of represents the sum of the flows through each edge in that has as a terminal vertex. The right-hand side indicates that you should add all of the flows through edges that initiate at .    Flow out of Source equals Flow in Sink   If is a flow, then   Subtract the right-hand side of from the left-hand side. The result is: Now sum up these differences for each vertex in . The result is   Now observe that if an edge connects two vertices in , its flow appears as both a positive and a negative term in . This means that the only positive terms that are not cancelled out are the flows into the sink. In addition, the only negative terms that remain are the flows out of the source. Therefore,   The Value of a Flow Value of a Flow  The value of flow  The two values flow into the sink and flow out of the source were proved to be equal in and this common value is called the value of the flow . It is denoted by . The value of a flow represents the amount of material that passes through the network with that flow.  Since the Maximum Flow Problem consists of maximizing the amount of material that passes through a given network, it is equivalent to finding a flow with the largest possible value. Any such flow is called a maximal flow Maximal flow .  For the network in , one flow is , defined by , , , , and . The value of , , is 45. Since the total flow into the sink can be no larger than 50 ( ), we can tell that is not very far from the solution. Can you improve on at all? The sum of the capacities into the sink can't always be obtained by a flow. The same is true for the sum of the capacities out of the source. In this case, the sum of the capacities out of the source is 60, which obviously can't be reached in this network.  A solution of the Maximum Flow Problem for this network is the maximal flow , where , , , , and , with . This solution is not unique. In fact, there is an infinite number of maximal flows for this problem.  There have been several algorithms developed to solve the Maximal Flow Problem. One of these is the Ford and Fulkerson Algorithm (FFA). The FFA consists of repeatedly finding paths in a network called flow augmenting paths until no improvement can be made in the flow that has been obtained.  Flow Augmenting Path Flow Augmenting Path  Given a flow in a network , a flow augmenting path with respect to is a simple path from the source to the sink using edges both in their forward and their reverse directions such that for each edge in the path, if is used in its forward direction and if is used in the reverse direction.  Augmenting City Water Flow  For in , a flow augmenting path would be since , , and .  These positive differences represent unused capacities, and the smallest value represents the amount of flow that can be added to each edge in the path. Note that by adding 5 to each edge in our path, we obtain , which is maximal. If an edge with a positive flow is used in its reverse direction, it is contributing a movement of material that is counterproductive to the objective of maximizing flow. This is why the algorithm directs us to decrease the flow through that edge.  The Ford and Fulkerson Algorithm    Define the flow function by for each edge .  i = 0.  Repeat:   If possible, find a flow augmenting path with respect to .  If a flow augmenting path exists, then:   Determine  Define by       until no flow augmenting path exists.  Terminate with a maximal flow     Notes on the Ford and Fulkerson Algorithm   It should be clear that every flow augmenting path leads to a flow of increased value and that none of the capacities of the network can be violated.  The depth-first search should be used to find flow augmenting paths since it is far more efficient than the breadth-first search in this situation. The depth-first search differs from the breadth-first algorithm in that you sequentially visit vertices until you reach a dead end and then backtrack.  There have been networks discovered for which the FFA does not terminate in a finite number of steps. These examples all have irrational capacities. It has been proven that if all capacities are positive integers, the FFA terminates in a finite number of steps. See Ford and Fulkerson, Even, or Berge for details.  When you use the FFA to solve the Maximum Flow Problem by hand it is convenient to label each edge of the network with the fraction .    Depth-First Search for a Flow Augmenting Path   This is a depth-first search for the Sink Initiating at the Source. Let be the set of directed edges that can be used in producing a flow augmenting path. Add to the network a vertex called start and the edge   vertex set of the network.  source Move along the edge   while is not equal to start or sink:   if an edge in exists that takes you from to another vertex in :  .         A flow augmenting path going against the flow Consider the network in , where the current flow, , is indicated by a labeling of the edges.   Current Flow   Current Flow    The path is a flow augmenting path that allows us to increase the flow by one unit. Note that is used in the reverse direction, which is allowed because . The value of the new flow that we obtain is 8. This flow must be maximal since the capacities out of the source add up to 8. This maximal flow is defined by .   Updated Flow   Updated Flow      Other Graph Optimization Problems   The Minimum Spanning Tree Problem: Given a weighted graph, , find a subset of with the properties that is connected and the sum of the weights of edges in is as small as possible. We will discuss this problem in Chapter 10.  The Minimum Matching Problem: Given an undirected weighted graph, , with an even number of vertices, pair up the vertices so that each pair is connected by an edge and the sum of these edges is as small as possible. A unit square version of this problem has been studied extensively. See for details on what is known about this version of the problem.  Center of a Graph The Graph Center Problem: Given a connected, undirected, weighted graph, find a vertex (called a center) in the graph with the property that the distance from the center to every other vertex is as small as possible. As small as possible is normally interpreted as minimizing the maximum distance from the center to a vertex.

  "body": " Planarity and Colorings  The topics in this section are related to how graphs are drawn.  Planarity: Can a given graph be drawn in a plane so that no edges intersect? Certainly, it is natural to avoid intersections, but up to now we haven't gone out of our way to do so.  Colorings: Suppose that each vertex in an undirected graph is to be colored so that no two vertices that are connected by an edge have the same color. How many colors are needed? This question is motivated by the problem of drawing a map so that no two bordering countries are colored the same. A similar question can be asked for coloring edges.   Planar Graphs  Planar Graph\/Plane Graph Planar Graph Plane Graph A graph is planar if it can be drawn in a plane so that no edges cross. If a graph is drawn so that no edges intersect, it is a plane graph, and such a drawing is a planar embedding of the graph.  A Planar Graph The graph in (a) is planar but not a plane graph. The same graph is drawn as a plane graph in (b).   A Planar Graph   A Planar Graph      In discussing planarity, we need only consider simple undirected graphs with no self-loops. All other graphs can be treated as such since all of the edges that relate any two vertices can be considered as one package that clearly can be drawn in a plane.  Can you think of a graph that is not planar? How would you prove that it isn't planar? Proving the nonexistence of something is usually more difficult than proving its existence. This case is no exception. Intuitively, we would expect that sparse graphs would be planar and dense graphs would be nonplanar. will verify that dense graphs are indeed nonplanar.  The topic of planarity is a result of trying to restrict a graph to two dimensions. Is there an analogous topic for three dimensions? What graphs can be drawn in one dimension?   Path Graph  Path Graph  a path graph of length  A path graph of length , denoted , is an undirected graph with vertices having edges , .  Graphs in other dimensions If a graph has only a finite number of vertices, it can always be drawn in three dimensions with no edge crossings. Is this also true for all graphs with an infinite number of vertices? The only one-dimensional graphs are graphs consisting of a single vertex, and path graphs, as shown in .    One dimensional graphs   One dimensional graphs    Three Utilities Puzzle A discussion of planarity is not complete without mentioning the famous Three Utilities Puzzle. The object of the puzzle is to supply three houses, A, B, and C, with the three utilities, gas, electric, and water. The constraint that makes this puzzle impossible to solve is that no utility lines may intersect. There is no planar embedding of the graph in , which is commonly denoted . This graph is one of two fundamental nonplanar graphs. The Kuratowski Reduction Theorem states that if a graph is nonplanar then it contains either a or a . Containment is in the sense that if you start with a nonplanar graph you can always perform a sequence of edge deletions and contractions (shrinking an edge so that the two vertices connecting it coincide) to produce one of the two graphs.   The Three Utilities Puzzle   The Three Utilities Puzzle    A planar graph divides the plane into one or more regions. Two points on the plane lie in the same region if you can draw a curve connecting the two points that does not pass through an edge. One of these regions will be of infinite area. Each point on the plane is either a vertex, a point on an edge, or a point in a region. A remarkable fact about the geography of planar graphs is the following theorem that is attributed to Euler.  Experiment: Jot down a graph right now and count the number of vertices, regions, and edges that you have. If is not 2, then your graph is either nonplanar or not connected.  Euler's Formula Euler's Formula   If is a connected planar graph with regions, vertices, and edges, then   We prove Euler's Formula by Induction on , for .  Basis: If , then must be a graph with one vertex, ; and there is one infinite region, . Therefore, , and the basis is true.  Induction: Suppose that has edges, , and that all connected planar graphs with less than edges satisfy . Select any edge that is part of the boundary of the infinite region and call it . Let be the graph obtained from by deleting . illustrates the two different possibilities we need to consider: either is connected or it has two connected components, and .   Two cases in the proof of Euler's Formula   Two cases in the proof of Euler's Formula    If is connected, the induction hypothesis can be applied to it. If has vertices, regions and edges, then and in terms of the corresponding numbers for ,  For the case where is connected, If is not connected, it must consist of two connected components, and , since we started with a connected graph, . We can apply the induction hypothesis to each of the two components to complete the proof. We leave it to the students to do this, with the reminder that in counting regions, and will share the same infinite region.   A Bound on Edges of a Planar Graph  If is a connected planar graph with vertices, , and edges, then  (Outline of a Proof)   Let be the number of regions in . For each region, count the number of edges that comprise its border. The sum of these counts must be at least . Recall that we are working with simple graphs here, so a region made by two edges connecting the same two vertices is not possible.  Based on (a), infer that the number of edges in must be at least .    Substitute for in Euler's Formula to obtain an inequality that is equivalent to    One implication of is that the number of edges in a connected planar graph will never be larger than three times its number of vertices (as long as it has at least three vertices). Since the maximum number of edges in a graph with vertices is a quadratic function of , as increases, planar graphs are more and more sparse.  The following theorem will be useful as we turn to graph coloring.  A Vertex of Degree Five  If is a connected planar graph, then it has a vertex with degree 5 or less.  (by contradiction): We can assume that has at least seven vertices, for otherwise the degree of any vertex is at most 5. Suppose that is a connected planar graph and each vertex has a degree of 6 or more. Then, since each edge contributes to the degree of two vertices, . However, states that the , which is a contradiction.   Graph Coloring   A 3-coloring of Euler Island   A 3-coloring of Euler Island    The map of Euler Island in shows that there are seven towns on the island. Suppose that a cartographer must produce a colored map in which no two towns that share a boundary have the same color. To keep costs down, she wants to minimize the number of different colors that appear on the map. How many colors are sufficient? For Euler Island, the answer is three. Although it might not be obvious, this is a graph problem. We can represent the map with a graph, where the vertices are countries and an edge between two vertices indicates that the two corresponding countries share a boundary of positive length. This problem motivates a more general problem.  Graph Coloring  Graph Coloring Chromatic Number  the chromatic number of  Given an undirected graph , find a coloring function  from into a set of colors such that and has the smallest possible cardinality. The cardinality of is called the chromatic number of , .   A coloring function onto an -element set is called an -coloring.  In terms of this general problem, the chromatic number of the graph of Euler Island is three. To see that no more than three colors are needed, we need only display a 3-coloring: , , and . This coloring is not unique. The next smallest set of colors would be of two colors, and you should be able to convince yourself that no 2-coloring exists for this graph.   In the mid-nineteenth century, it became clear that the typical planar graph had a chromatic number of no more than 4. At that point, mathematicians attacked the Four-Color Conjecture, which is that if is any planar graph, then its chromatic number is no more than 4. Although the conjecture is quite easy to state, it took over 100 years, until 1976, to prove the conjecture in the affirmative.  The Four-Color Theorem Four-Color Theorem  If is a planar graph, then .   A proof of the Four-Color Theorem is beyond the scope of this text, but we can prove a theorem that is only 25 percent inferior.  The Five-Color Theorem Five-Color Theorem  If is a planar graph, then .   The number 5 is not a sharp upper bound for because of the Four-Color Theorem.  This is a proof by Induction on the Number of Vertices in the Graph.  Basis: Clearly, a graph with one vertex has a chromatic number of 1.  Induction: Assume that all planar graphs with vertices have a chromatic number of 5 or less. Let be a planar graph. By , there exists a vertex with . Let be the planar graph obtained by deleting and all edges that connect to other vertices in . By the induction hypothesis, has a 5-coloring. Assume that the colors used are red, white, blue, green, and yellow.  If , then we can produce a 5-coloring of by selecting a color that is not used in coloring the vertices that are connected to with an edge in .  If , then we can use the same approach if the five vertices that are adjacent to are not all colored differently. We are now left with the possibility that , , , , and are all connected to by an edge and they are all colored differently. Assume that they are colored red, white blue, yellow, and green, respectively, as in .    Figure used in the proof of the five color theorem    Starting at in , suppose we try to construct a path that passes through only red and blue vertices. This can either be accomplished or it can't be accomplished. If it can't be done, consider all paths that start at , and go through only red and blue vertices. If we exchange the colors of the vertices in these paths, including we still have a 5-coloring of . Since is now blue, we can color the central vertex, , red.  Finally, suppose that is connected to using only red and blue vertices. Then a path from to by using red and blue vertices followed by the edges and completes a circuit that either encloses or encloses and . Therefore, no path from to exists using only white and yellow vertices. We can then repeat the same process as in the previous paragraph with and , which will allow us to color v white.   Bipartite Graph Bipartite Graph.  A bipartite graph is a graph that has a 2-coloring. Equivalently, a graph is bipartite if its vertices can be partitioned into two nonempty subsets so that no edge connects vertices from the same subset.   A Few Examples   The graph of the Three Utilities Puzzle is bipartite. The vertices are partitioned into the utilities and the homes. Of course a 2-coloring of the graph is to color the utilities red and the homes blue.  For , the -cube is bipartite. A coloring would be to color all strings with an even number of 1's red and the strings with an odd number of 1's blue. By the definition of the -cube, two strings that have the same color couldn't be connected since they would need to differ in at least two positions.  Let be a set of 64 vertices, one for each square on a chess board. We can index the elements of by = the square on the row , column . Connect vertices in according to whether or not you can move a knight from one square to another. Using our indexing of ,  is a bipartite graph. The usual coloring of a chessboard is valid 2-coloring.    How can you recognize whether a graph is bipartite? Unlike planarity, there is a nice equivalent condition for a graph to be bipartite.  No Odd Circuits in a Bipartite Graph An undirected graph is bipartite if and only if it has no circuit of odd length.  ( ) Let be a bipartite graph that is partitioned into two sets, R(ed) and B(lue) that define a 2-coloring. Consider any circuit in . If we specify a direction in the circuit and define on the vertices of the circuit by Note that is a bijection. Hence the number of red vertices in the circuit equals the number of blue vertices, and so the length of the circuit must be even.  ( ) Assume that has no circuit of odd length. For each component of , select any vertex and color it red. Then for every other vertex in the component, find the path of shortest distance from to . If the length of the path is odd, color blue, and if it is even, color red. We claim that this method defines a 2-coloring of . Suppose that it does not define a 2-coloring. Then let and be two vertices with identical colors that are connected with an edge. By the way that we colored , neither nor could equal . We can now construct a circuit with an odd length in . First, we start at and follow the shortest path to . Then follow the edge , and finally, follow the reverse of a shortest path from to . Since and have the same color, the first and third segments of this circuit have lengths that are both odd or even, and the sum of their lengths must be even. The addition of the single edge shows us that this circuit has an odd length. This contradicts our premise.    Exercises  Apply to prove that once gets to a certain size, a is nonplanar. What is the largest complete planar graph? can be applied to infer that if , then is nonplanar. A is the largest complete planar graph.  Can you apply to prove that the Three Utilities Puzzle can't be solved?  What are the chromatic numbers of the following graphs?   What are the chromatic numbers?   What are the chromatic numbers?     4  3  3  3  2  4   A connected planar graph has vertices and divides the plane into regions. How many edges does it have?  What is , ? The chromatic number is since every vertex is connected to every other vertex.  Suppose that all of the vertices of connected planar graph have degree 3 and that there are 20 vertices. How many edges and regions does this graph have?  Complete the proof of . Suppose that is not connected. Then is made up of 2 components that are planar graphs with less than edges, and . For let be the number of vertices, regions and edges in . By the induction hypothesis, for .  One of the regions, the infinite one, is common to both graphs. Therefore, when we add edge back to the graph, we have , , and .   Use the outline of a proof of to write a complete proof. Be sure to point out where the premise is essential.  Let with , and let be the set of all undirected edges between distinct vertices in . Prove that either or is nonplanar. Since , either has at least elements. Assume that it is that is larger. Since is greater than , would be nonplanar. Of course, if is larger, then would be nonplanar by the same reasoning. Can you find a graph with ten vertices such that it is planar and its complement is also planar?  Design an algorithm to determine whether a graph is bipartite.  Prove that a bipartite graph with an odd number of vertices greater than or equal to 3 has no Hamiltonian circuit. Suppose that is bipartite (with colors red and blue), is odd, and is a Hamiltonian circuit. If is red, then would also be red. But then would not be in , a contradiction.  Prove that any graph with a finite number of vertices can be drawn in three dimensions so that no edges intersect.  Suppose you had to color the edges of an undirected graph so that for each vertex, the edges that it is connected to have different colors. How can this problem be transformed into a vertex coloring problem? Draw a graph with one vertex for each edge, If two edges in the original graph meet at the same vertex, then draw an edge connecting the corresponding vertices in the new graph.    Suppose the edges of a are colored either red or blue. Prove that there will be either a red (a subset of the vertex set with three vertices connected by red edges) or a blue or both.  Suppose six people are selected at random. Prove that either there exists a subset of three of them with the property that any two people in the subset can communicate in a common language, or there exist three people, no two of whom can communicate in a common language.    Mesh Graph Let be a positive integer, and let be positive integers greater than or equal to two. The mesh graph  has vertices of the form where . Two vertices and are adjacent if and only if . In other words, two adjacent vertices must differ in only one coordinate and by a difference of 1.    What is the chromatic number of ?  For what pairs does have a Hamiltonian circuit?   For what triples does have a Hamiltonian circuit?     Further Reading  Wilson, R., Four Colors Suffice - How the Map Problem Was Solved Princeton, NJ: Princeton U. Press, 2013.   "

Recall that a path is a sequence of consecutive edges in a graph, and a circuit is a path that begins and ends at the same vertex.  Cycle  Cycle A cycle with edges. A cycle is a circuit whose edge list contains no duplicates. It is customary to use to denote a cycle with edges.  The simplest example of a cycle in an undirected graph is a pair of vertices with two edges connecting them. Since trees are cycle-free, we can rule out all multigraphs having at least one pair of vertices connected with two or more edges from consideration as trees.  Trees can either be undirected or directed graphs. We will concentrate on the undirected variety in this chapter.  Tree  Tree  An undirected graph is a tree if it is connected and contains no cycles.  Some trees and non-trees   Some trees and some non-trees   Some trees and some non-trees     Graphs i, ii and iii in are all trees, while graphs iv, v, and vi are not trees.   A is a tree. However, if , a is not a tree.  In a loose sense, a botanical tree is a mathematical tree. There are usually no cycles in the branch structure of a botanical tree.  The structures of some chemical compounds are modeled by a tree. For example, butane consists of four carbon atoms and ten hydrogen atoms, where an edge between two atoms represents a bond between them. A bond is a force that keeps two atoms together. The same set of atoms can be linked together in a different tree structure to give us the compound isobutane . There are some compounds whose graphs are not trees. One example is benzene .      Butane   Structure of Butane     Isobutane   Structure of Isobutane     Benzene   Structure of Benzene      One type of graph that is not a tree, but is closely related, is a forest.  Forest  Forest. A forest is an undirected graph whose components are all trees.  A forest The top half of can be viewed as a forest of three trees. Graph (vi) in this figure is also a forest.   Conditions for a Graph to be a Tree  We will now examine several conditions that are equivalent to the one that defines a tree. The following theorem will be used as a tool in proving that the conditions are equivalent.   Let be an undirected graph with no self-loops, and let . If two different simple paths exist between and , then there exists a cycle in .  Let and be two different simple paths from to . The first step we will take is to delete from and the initial edges that are identical. That is, if , , , and delete the first edges of both paths. Once this is done, both paths start at the same vertex, call it , and both still end at . Now we construct a cycle by starting at and following what is left of until we first meet what is left of . If this first meeting occurs at vertex , then the remainder of the cycle is completed by following the portion of the reverse of that starts at and ends at .    Equivalent Conditions for a Graph to be a Tree  Let be an undirected graph with no self-loops and . The following are all equivalent:    is a tree.  For each pair of distinct vertices in , there exists a unique simple path between them.   is connected, and if , then is disconnected.   contains no cycles, but by adding one edge, you create a cycle.   is connected and .     Proof Strategy. Most of this theorem can be proven by proving the following chain of implications: , , , and . Once these implications have been demonstrated, the transitive closure of on establishes the equivalence of the first four conditions. The proof that Statement 5 is equivalent to the first four can be done by induction, which we will leave to the reader.  (Indirect). Assume that is a tree and that there exists a pair of vertices between which there is either no path or there are at least two distinct paths. Both of these possibilities contradict the premise that is a tree. If no path exists, is disconnected, and if two paths exist, a cycle can be obtained by .  . We now use Statement 2 as a premise. Since each pair of vertices in are connected by exactly one path, is connected. Now if we select any edge in , it connects two vertices, and . By (2), there is no simple path connecting to other than . Therefore, no path at all can exist between and in . Hence is disconnected.  . Now we will assume that Statement 3 is true. We must show that has no cycles and that adding an edge to creates a cycle. We will use an indirect proof for this part. Since (4) is a conjunction, by DeMorgan's Law its negation is a disjunction and we must consider two cases. First, suppose that has a cycle. Then the deletion of any edge in the cycle keeps the graph connected, which contradicts (3). The second case is that the addition of an edge to does not create a cycle. Then there are two distinct paths between the vertices that the new edge connects. By , a cycle can then be created, which is a contradiction.  Assume that contains no cycles and that the addition of an edge creates a cycle. All that we need to prove to verify that is a tree is that is connected. If it is not connected, then select any two vertices that are not connected. If we add an edge to connect them, the fact that a cycle is created implies that a second path between the two vertices can be found which is in the original graph, which is a contradiction.    The usual definition of a directed tree is based on whether the associated undirected graph, which is created by erasing its directional arrows, is a tree. In Section 10.3 we will introduce the rooted tree, which is a special type of directed tree.    Exercises  Given the following vertex sets, draw all possible undirected trees that connect them.         .   The number of trees are: (a) 1, (b) 3, and (c) 16.

A graph of Atlantis University ( ) shows that there are four campuses in the system. A new secure communications system is being installed and the objective is to allow for communication between any two campuses; to achieve this objective, the university must buy direct lines between certain pairs of campuses. Let be the graph with a vertex for each campus and an edge for each direct line. Total communication is equivalent to being a connected graph. This is due to the fact that two campuses can communicate over any number of lines. To minimize costs, the university wants to buy a minimum number of lines.   Atlantis University Graph   Atlantis University Graph    The solutions to this problem are all trees. Any graph that satisfies the requirements of the university must be connected, and if a cycle does exist, any line in the cycle can be deleted, reducing the cost. Each of the sixteen trees that can be drawn to connect the vertices North, South, East, and West (see ) solves the problem as it is stated. Note that in each case, three direct lines must be purchased. There are two considerations that can help reduce the number of solutions that would be considered.   Objective 1: Given that the cost of each line depends on certain factors, such as the distance between the campuses, select a tree whose cost is as low as possible.  Objective 2: Suppose that communication over multiple lines is noisier as the number of lines increases. Select a tree with the property that the maximum number of lines that any pair of campuses must use to communicate with is as small as possible.   Typically, these objectives are not compatible; that is, you cannot always simultaneously achieve these objectives. In the case of the Atlantis university system, the solution with respect to Objective 1 is indicated with solid lines in . There are four solutions to the problem with respect to Objective 2: any tree in which one campus is directly connected to the other three. One solution with respect to Objective 2 is indicated with dotted lines in . After satisfying the conditions of Objective 2, it would seem reasonable to select the cheapest of the four trees.   Definition  Spanning Tree  Spanning Tree  Let be a connected undirected graph. A spanning tree for is a spanning subgraph of that is a tree.     If is a spanning tree, .  The significance of a spanning tree is that it is a minimal spanning set. A smaller set would not span the graph, while a larger set would have a cycle, which has an edge that is superfluous.    For the remainder of this section, we will discuss two of the many topics that relate to spanning trees. The first is the problem of finding Minimal Spanning Trees, which addresses Objective 1 above. The second is the problem of finding Minimum Diameter Spanning Trees, which addresses Objective 2.  Minimal Spanning Tree  Minimal Spanning Tree  Given a weighted connected undirected graph , a minimal spanning tree is a spanning tree for which is as small as possible.   Prim's Algorithm  Unlike many of the graph-optimization problems that we've examined, a solution to this problem can be obtained efficiently. It is a situation in which a greedy algorithm works.  Bridge  Bridge  Let be an undirected graph and let be a partition of . A bridge between and is an edge in that connects a vertex in to a vertex in .   Let be a weighted connected undirected graph. Let be partitioned into two sets and . If is a bridge of least weight between and , then there exists a minimal spanning tree for that includes .  Suppose that no minimal spanning tree including exists. Let be a minimal spanning tree. If we add to , a cycle is created, and this cycle must contain another bridge, , between and . Since , we can delete and the new tree, which includes must also be a minimal spanning tree.  Some Bridges The bridges between the vertex sets and in are the edges and . According to the theorem above, a minimal spanning tree that includes exists. By examination, you should be able to see that this is true. Is it true that only the bridges of minimal weight can be part of a minimal spanning tree?   Bridges between two sets   Bridges between two sets     essentially tells us that a minimal spanning tree can be constructed recursively by continually adding minimally weighted bridges to a set of edges.  Prim's Algorithm Prim's Algorithm  Let be a connected, weighted, undirected graph, and let be an arbitrary vertex in . The following steps lead to a minimal spanning tree for . and will be sets of vertices and is a set of edges.   (Initialize) ; ; .  (Build the tree) While :   Find , a bridge of minimum weight between and .   ; ;   Terminate with a minimal spanning tree .       If more than one minimal spanning tree exists, then the one that is obtained depends on and the means by which is selected in Step 2.  Warning: If two minimally weighted bridges exist between and , do not try to speed up the algorithm by adding both of them to '.  That yields a minimal spanning tree can be proven by induction with the use of .  If it is not known whether is connected, can be revised to handle this possibility. The key change (in Step 2.1) would be to determine whether any bridge at all exists between and . The condition of the while loop in Step 2 must also be changed somewhat.    A Small Example Consider the graph in . If we apply starting at , we obtain the following edge list in the order given: . The total of the weights of these edges is 20. The method that we have used (in Step 2.1) to select a bridge when more than one minimally weighted bridge exists is to order all bridges alphabetically by the vertex in and then, if further ties exist, by the vertex in . The first vertex in that order is selected in Step 2.1 of the algorithm.   A small weighted graph   A weighted graph     Minimum Diameter Spanning Tree Minimum Diameter Spanning Tree  Given a connected undirected graph , find a spanning tree of such that the longest path in is as short as possible.  The Case for Complete Graphs The Minimum Diameter Spanning Tree Problem is trivial to solve in a . Select any vertex and construct the spanning tree whose edge set is the set of edges that connect to the other vertices in the . illustrates a solution for .   Minimum diameter spanning tree for    Minimum diameter spanning tree for K_5     For incomplete graphs, a two-stage algorithm is needed. In short, the first step is to locate a center of the graph. The maximum distance from a center to any other vertex is as small as possible. Once a center is located, a breadth-first search of the graph is used to construct the spanning tree.    Exercises  Suppose that after Atlantis University's phone system is in place, a fifth campus is established and that a transmission line can be bought to connect the new campus to any old campus. Is this larger system the most economical one possible with respect to Objective 1? Can you always satisfy Objective 2?  It might not be most economical with respect to Objective 1. You should be able to find an example to illustrate this claim. The new system can always be made most economical with respect to Objective 2 if the old system were designed with that objective in mind.

Definition and Terminology   A Rooted Tree   A Rooted Tree    Informal Definition and Terminology genealogical terms  What differentiates rooted trees from undirected trees is that a rooted tree contains a distinguished vertex, called the root. Consider the tree in . Vertex has been designated the root of the tree. If we choose any other vertex in the tree, such as , we know that there is a unique path from to . The vertices on this path, , are described in genealogical terms:   is a child of (so is )  is 's parent.  , , and are 's ancestors.  , , and are descendants of .   These genealogical relationships are often easier to visualize if the tree is rewritten so that children are positioned below their parents, as in .  With this format, it is easy to see that each vertex in the tree can be thought of as the root of a tree that contains, in addition to itself, all of its descendants. For example, is the root of a tree that contains , , , and . Furthermore, is the root of a tree that contains , , and . Finally, and are roots of trees that contain only themselves. From this observation, we can give a formal definition of a rooted tree.    A Rooted Tree, redrawn   A Rooted Tree, redrawn    One can formally define the genealogical terms above. We define child here since it's used in our formal definition of a rooted tree and leave the rest of the definitions as an exercise.  Child of a Root  Child of a Root Parent of a vertex  Given a rooted tree with root , a child of is a vertex that is connected to by an edge of the tree. We refer to the root as the parent of each of its children.    Rooted Tree  Rooted Tree    A single vertex with no children is a rooted tree with root .  Recursion: Let , , be disjoint rooted trees with roots , , , respectively, and let be a vertex that does not belong to any of these trees. Then a rooted tree, rooted at , is obtained by making the parent of the vertices , , and . We call subtrees of the larger tree.     The level of a vertex Level of a vertex of a rooted tree is the number of edges that separate the vertex from the root. The level of the root is zero. The depth of a tree is the maximum level of the vertices in the tree. The depth of a tree in is three, which is the level of the vertices and . The vertices , , , , , , and have level two. , , and are at level one and has level zero.  A Decision Tree is a rooted tree with Start as the root. It is an example of what is called a decision tree.  Tree Structure of Data One of the keys to working with large amounts of information is to organize it in a consistent, logical way. A data structure is a scheme for organizing data. A simple example of a data structure might be the information a college admissions department might keep on their applicants. Items might look something like this: This structure is called a flat file .  A spreadsheet can be used to arrange data in this way. Although a flat file structure is often adequate, there are advantages to clustering some the information. For example the applicant information might be broken into four parts: name, contact information, high school, and application data: The first item in each ApplicantItem is a list , with each item in that list being a single field of the original flat file. The third item is simply the single high school item from the flat file. The application data is a list and one of its items, is itself a list with the recommendation data for each recommendation the applicant has.  The organization of this data can be visualized with a rooted tree such as the one in .   Applicant Data in a Rooted Tree   Applicant Data in a Rooted Tree    In general, you can represent a data item, , as a rooted tree with as the root and a subtree for each field. Those fields that are more than just one item are roots of further subtrees, while individual items have no further children in the tree.    Kruskal's Algorithm  An alternate algorithm for constructing a minimal spanning tree uses a forest of rooted trees. First we will describe the algorithm in its simplest terms. Afterward, we will describe how rooted trees are used to implement the algorithm. Finally, we will demonstrate the SageMath implementation of the algorithm. In all versions of this algorithm, assume that is a weighted undirected graph with and .  Kruskal's Algorithm - Informal Version    Sort the edges of in ascending order according to weight. That is, .  Go down the list from Step 1 and add edges to a set (initially empty) of edges so that the set does not form a cycle. When an edge that would create a cycle is encountered, ignore it. Continue examining edges until either edges have been selected or you have come to the end of the edge list. If edges are selected, these edges make up a minimal spanning tree for . If fewer than edges are selected, is not connected.     Step 1 can be accomplished using one of any number of standard sorting routines. Using the most efficient sorting routine, the time required to perform this step is proportional to . The second step of the algorithm, also of time complexity, is the one that uses a forest of rooted trees to test for whether an edge should be added to the spanning set.  Kruskal's Algorithm Kruskal's Algorithm    Sort the edges of in ascending order according to weight. That is, .    Initialize each vertex in V to be the root of its own rooted tree.  Go down the list of edges until either a spanning tree is completed or the edge list has been exhausted. For each edge , we can determine whether e can be added to the spanning set without forming a cycle by determining whether the root of tree is equal to the root of tree. If the two roots are equal, then ignore e. If the roots are different, then we can add e to the spanning set. In addition, we merge the trees that and belong to. This is accomplished by either making root the parent of root or vice versa.       Since we start the Kruskal's algorithm with trees and each addition of an edge decreases the number of trees by one, we end the algorithm with one rooted tree, provided a spanning tree exists.  The rooted tree that we develop in the algorithm is not the spanning tree itself.     SageMath Note - Implementation of Kruskal's Algorithm SageMath Note Kruskal's Algorithm  Kruskal's algorithm has been implemented in Sage. We illustrate how the spanning tree for a weighted graph in can be generated. First, we create such a graph  We will create a graph using a list of triples of the form . The method tells Sage to consider the labels as weights.    Weighed graph, SageMath output   SageMath Output - Weighted Graph    Next, we load the kruskal function and use it to generate the list of edges in a spanning tree of .   To see the resulting tree with the same embedding as , we generate a graph from the spanning tree edges. Next, we set the positions of the vertices to be the same as in the graph. Finally, we plot the tree.    Spanning tree, SageMath output   SageMath Output - Spanning tree for weighted graph      Exercises   Suppose that an undirected tree has diameter and that you would like to select a vertex of the tree as a root so that the resulting rooted tree has the smallest depth possible. How would such a root be selected and what would be the depth of the tree (in terms of )?  Locate any simple path of length and locate the vertex in position on the path. The tree rooted at that vertex will have a depth of , which is minimal.  Use Kruskal's algorithm to find a minimal spanning tree for the following graphs. In addition to the spanning tree, find the final rooted tree in the algorithm. When you merge two trees in the algorithm, make the root with the lower number the root of the new tree.    Figure for exercise 10-3-2a      Figure for exercise 10-3-2b     Suppose that information on buildings is arranged in records with five fields: the name of the building, its location, its owner, its height, and its floor space. The location and owner fields are records that include all of the information that you would expect, such as street, city, and state, together with the owner's name (first, middle, last) in the owner field. Draw a rooted tree to describe this type of record     Solution to exercise 10-3-3     Step through Kruskal's Algorithm by hand to verify that the example of a minimal spanning tree using Sage in is correct.

An empty tree and a single vertex with no descendants (no subtrees) are ordered rooted trees.  Distinct Ordered Rooted Trees The trees in are identical rooted trees, with root 1, but as ordered trees, they are different.   Two different ordered rooted trees   Two different ordered rooted trees     If a tree rooted at has subtrees, we would refer to them as the first, second,..., subtrees. There is a subtle difference between certain ordered trees and binary trees, which we define next.  Binary Tree  Binary Tree    A tree consisting of no vertices (the empty tree) is a binary tree  A vertex together with two subtrees that are both binary trees is a binary tree. The subtrees are called the left and right subtrees of the binary tree.    The difference between binary trees and ordered trees is that every vertex of a binary tree has exactly two subtrees (one or both of which may be empty), while a vertex of an ordered tree may have any number of subtrees. But there is another significant difference between the two types of structures. The two trees in would be considered identical as ordered trees. However, they are different binary trees. Tree (a) has an empty right subtree and Tree (b) has an empty left subtree.   Two different binary trees   Two different binary trees    Terminology and General Facts about Binary Trees Full binary tree   Leaf of a binary tree A vertex of a binary tree with two empty subtrees is called a leaf Leaf, of a binary tree . All other vertices are called internal vertices .  The number of leaves in a binary tree can vary from one up to roughly half the number of vertices in the tree (see Exercise 4 of this section).  The maximum number of vertices at level of a binary tree is , (see Exercise 6 of this section).  Full binary tree A full binary tree is a tree for which each vertex has either zero or two empty subtrees. In other words, each vertex has either two or zero children. See of this section for a general fact about full binary trees.     Traversals of Binary Trees Traversals of Binary Trees  The traversal of a binary tree consists of visiting each vertex of the tree in some prescribed order. Unlike graph traversals, the consecutive vertices that are visited are not always connected with an edge. The most common binary tree traversals are differentiated by the order in which the root and its subtrees are visited. The three traversals are best described recursively and are:  Preorder Traversal:  Visit the root of the tree.  Preorder traverse the left subtree.  Preorder traverse the right subtree.    Inorder Traversal:  Inorder traverse the left subtree.  Visit the root of the tree.  Inorder traverse the right subtree.    Postorder Traversal:  Postorder traverse the left subtree.  Postorder traverse the right subtree.  Visit the root of the tree.     Any traversal of an empty tree consists of doing nothing.  Traversal Examples For the tree in , the orders in which the vertices are visited are:  A-B-D-E-C-F-G, for the preorder traversal.  D-B-E-A-F-C-G, for the inorder traversal.  D-E-B-F-G-C-A, for the postorder traversal.    A Complete Binary Tree to Level 2   A Complete Binary Tree to Level 2     Binary Tree Sort. Given a collection of integers (or other objects than can be ordered), one technique for sorting is a binary tree sort. If the integers are , , , , we first execute the following algorithm that creates a binary tree:  Binary Sort Tree Creation    Insert into the root of the tree.  For k := 2 to n \/\/ insert into the tree   r =  inserted = false  while not(inserted):  if :  if has a left child:  r = left child of  else:  make the left child of   inserted = true  else:  if has a right child:  r = right child of  else:  make the right child of   inserted = true       If the integers to be sorted are 25, 17, 9, 20, 33, 13, and 30, then the tree that is created is the one in . The inorder traversal of this tree is 9, 13, 17, 20, 25, 30, 33, the integers in ascending order. In general, the inorder traversal of the tree that is constructed in the algorithm above will produce a sorted list. The preorder and postorder traversals of the tree have no meaning here.   A Binary Sorting Tree   Binary Sorting Tree     Expression Trees Expression Tree  A convenient way to visualize an algebraic expression is by its expression tree. Consider the expression Since it is customary to put a precedence on multiplication\/divisions, is evaluated as . Consecutive multiplication\/divisions or addition\/subtractions are evaluated from left to right. We can analyze further by noting that it is the sum of two simpler expressions and . The first of these expressions can be broken down further into the difference of the expressions and . When we decompose any expression into , the expression tree of that expression is the binary tree whose root contains the operation and whose left and right subtrees are the trees of the left and right expressions, respectively. Additionally, a simple variable or a number has an expression tree that is a single vertex containing the variable or number. The evolution of the expression tree for expression appears in .   Building an Expression Tree   Building an Expression Tree    Some Expression Trees   If we intend to apply the addition and subtraction operations in first, we would parenthesize the expression to . Its expression tree appears in (a).  The expression trees for and for appear in (b) and (c).    Expression Tree Examples   Expression Tree Examples     The three traversals of an operation tree are all significant. A binary operation applied to a pair of numbers can be written in three ways. One is the familiar infix form, such as for the sum of and . Another form is prefix, in which the same sum is written . The final form is postfix, in which the sum is written . Algebraic expressions involving the four standard arithmetic operations in prefix and postfix form are defined as follows:   Prefix and postfix forms of an algebraic expression   Prefix  A variable or number is a prefix expression  Any operation followed by a pair of prefix expressions is a prefix expression.  Postfix  A variable or number is a postfix expression  Any pair of postfix expressions followed by an operation is a postfix expression.    The connection between traversals of an expression tree and these forms is simple:   The preorder traversal of an expression tree will result in the prefix form of the expression.  The postorder traversal of an expression tree will result in the postfix form of the expression.  The inorder traversal of an operation tree will not, in general, yield the proper infix form of the expression. If an expression requires parentheses in infix form, an inorder traversal of its expression tree has the effect of removing the parentheses.    Traversing an Expression Tree The preorder traversal of the tree in is , which is the prefix version of expression . The postorder traversal is . Note that since the original form of needed no parentheses, the inorder traversal, , is the correct infix version.    Counting Binary Trees Counting Binary Trees  We close this section with a formula for the number of different binary trees with vertices. The formula is derived using generating functions. Although the complete details are beyond the scope of this text, we will supply an overview of the derivation in order to illustrate how generating functions are used in advanced combinatorics.  Let be the number of different binary trees of size ( vertices), . By our definition of a binary tree, . Now consider any positive integer , . A binary tree of size has two subtrees, the sizes of which add up to . The possibilities can be broken down into cases:   Case 0: Left subtree has size 0; right subtree has size .  Case 1: Left subtree has size 1; right subtree has size .    Case : Left subtree has size ; right subtree has size .    Case : Left subtree has size ; right subtree has size 0.   In the general Case , we can count the number of possibilities by multiplying the number of ways that the left subtree can be filled, , by the number of ways that the right subtree can be filled. . Since the sum of these products equals , we obtain the recurrence relation for :   Now take the generating function of both sides of this recurrence relation: or  Recall that If we abbreviate to , we get Using the quadratic equation we find two solutions:   The gap in our derivation occurs here since we don't presume a knowledge of calculus. If we expand as an extended power series, we find  The coefficients after the first one are all negative and there is a singularity at 0 because of the term. However if we do the same with we get  Further analysis leads to a closed form expression for , which is This sequence of numbers is often called the Catalan numbers . For more information on the Catalan numbers, see the entry A000108 in The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences .   SageMath Note - Power Series SageMath Note Power Series  It may be of interest to note how the extended power series expansions of and are determined using Sage. In Sage, one has the capability of being very specific about how algebraic expressions should be interpreted by specifying the underlying ring. This can make working with various algebraic expressions a bit more confusing to the beginner. Here is how to get a Laurent expansion for above.   The first Sage expression above declares a structure called a ring that contains power series. We are not using that whole structure, just a specific element, G1 . So the important thing about this first input is that it establishes z as being a variable associated with power series over the integers. When the second expression defines the value of G1 in terms of z , it is automatically converted to a power series.  The expansion of uses identical code, and its coefficients are the values of .   In Chapter 16 we will introduce rings and will be able to take further advantage of Sage's capabilities in this area.    Exercises  Draw the expression trees for the following expressions:                    Solution to exercise 10-4-1-A      Solution to exercise 10-4-1-B     Draw the expression trees for         Write out the preorder, inorder, and postorder traversals of the trees in Exercise 1 above.      Verify the formula for , by drawing all binary trees with three or fewer vertices.     Draw a binary tree with seven vertices and only one leaf. Your answer won't be unique. How many different possible answers are there?  Draw a binary tree with seven vertices and as many leaves as possible.   There are different possible answers to part (a). The answer to (b) is unique.    Solution to exercise 10-4-5     Prove that the maximum number of vertices at level of a binary tree is and that a tree with that many vertices at level must have vertices.   Prove that if is a full binary tree, then the number of leaves of is one more than the number of internal vertices (non-leaves).  Solution 1:  Basis: A binary tree consisting of a single vertex, which is a leaf, satisfies the equation  Induction:Assume that for some , all full binary trees with or fewer vertices have one more leaf than internal vertices. Now consider any full binary tree with vertices. Let and be the left and right subtrees of the tree which, by the definition of a full binary tree, must both be full. If and are the numbers of internal vertices in and , and and are the numbers of leaves, then and . Therefore, in the whole tree,   Solution 2: Imagine building a full binary tree starting with a single vertex. By continuing to add leaves in pairs so that the tree stays full, we can build any full binary tree. Our starting tree satisfies the condition that the number of leaves is one more than the number of internal vertices . By adding a pair of leaves to a full binary tree, an old leaf becomes an internal vertex, increasing the number of internal vertices by one. Although we lose a leaf, the two added leaves create a net increase of one leaf. Therefore, the desired equality is maintained.    There is a one to one correspondence between ordered rooted trees and binary trees. If you start with an ordered rooted tree, , you can build a binary tree with an empty right subtree by placing the the root of at the root of . Then for every vertex from that has been placed in , place it's leftmost child (if there is one) as 's left child in . Make 's next sibling (if there is one) in the right child in .

Why will have no right children in this correspondence?  Draw the binary tree that is produced by the ordered rooted tree in .  The left subtree of the binary tree in is one of 5 different binary trees with three vertices. Draw each of them and also the ordered rooted tree that each corresponds with.  What does this correspondence tell us about how the numbers of different binary trees and ordered rooted trees are related?    What binary tree does this correspond with?   An ordered rooted tree.

  "body": " Operations  Operations  One of the first mathematical skills that we all learn is how to add a pair of positive integers. A young child soon recognizes that something is wrong if a sum has two values, particularly if his or her sum is different from the teacher's. In addition, it is unlikely that a child would consider assigning a non-positive value to the sum of two positive integers. In other words, at an early age we probably know that the sum of two positive integers is unique and belongs to the set of positive integers. This is what characterizes all binary operations on a set.  What is an Operation?  Binary Operation Binary Operation. generic symbol for a binary operation Let be a nonempty set. A binary operation on is a rule that assigns to each ordered pair of elements of a unique element of . In other words, a binary operation is a function from into .  Some common binary operations Union and intersection are both binary operations on the power set of any universe. Addition and multiplication are binary operators on the natural numbers. Addition and multiplication are binary operations on the set of 2 by 2 real matrices, . Division is a binary operation on some sets of numbers, such as the positive reals. But on the integers ( ) and even on the real numbers is not defined), division is not a binary operation.   We stress that the image of each ordered pair must be in . This requirement disqualifies subtraction on the natural numbers from consideration as a binary operation, since is not a natural number. Subtraction is a binary operation on the integers.  On Notation. Despite the fact that a binary operation is a function, symbols, not letters, are used to name them. The most commonly used symbol for a binary operation is an asterisk, . We will also use a diamond, , when a second symbol is needed.    If is a binary operation on and , there are three common ways of denoting the image of the pair . They are: We are all familiar with infix form. For example, is how everyone is taught to write the sum of 2 and 3. But notice how was just described in the previous sentence! The word sum preceded 2 and 3. Orally, prefix form is quite natural to us. The prefix and postfix forms are superior to infix form in some respects. In Chapter 10, we saw that algebraic expressions with more than one operation didn't need parentheses if they were in prefix or postfix form. However, due to our familiarity with infix form, we will use it throughout most of the remainder of this book.  Some operations, such as negation of numbers and complementation of sets, are not binary, but unary operators.  Unary Operation Unary Operation. Let be a nonempty set. A unary operator on is a rule that assigns to each element of a unique element of . In other words, a unary operator is a function from into .   Properties of Operations Properties of Operations  Whenever an operation on a set is encountered, there are several properties that should immediately come to mind. To effectively make use of an operation, you should know which of these properties it has. By now, you should be familiar with most of these properties. We will list the most common ones here to refresh your memory and define them for the first time in a general setting.  First we list properties of a single binary operation.  Commutative Property Commutative Property Let be a binary operation on a set . We say that is commutative if and only if for all .  Associative Property Associative Property Let be a binary operation on a set . We say that is associative if and only if for all .  Identity Property Identity Property Let be a binary operation on a set . We say that  has an identity if and only if there exists an element, , in such that for all .  The next property presumes that has the identity property.  Inverse Property Inverse Property Let be a binary operation on a set . We say that has the inverse property if and only if for each , there exists such that . We call an inverse of .  Idempotent Property Idempotent Property Let be a binary operation on a set . We say that is idempotent if and only if for all .  Now we list properties that apply to two binary operations.  Left Distributive Property Left Distributive Property Let and be binary operations on a set . We say that is left distributive over if and only if for all .  Right Distributive Property Right Distributive Property Let and be binary operations on a set . We say that is right distributive over if and only if for all .  Distributive Property Distributive Property Let and be binary operations on a set . We say that is distributive over if and only if is both left and right distributive over .  There is one significant property of unary operations.  Involution Property Involution Property Let be a unary operation on . We say that has the involution property if for all .  Finally, a property of sets, as they relate to operations.  Closure Property Closure Property Let be a subset of and let be a binary operation on . We say that is closed under if implies that .  In other words, is closed under if by operating on elements of with , you can't get new elements that are outside of .  Some examples of closure and non-closure   The odd integers are closed under multiplication, but not under addition.  Let be a proposition over and let be the set of propositions over that imply . That is; if . Then is closed under both conjunction and disjunction.  The set of positive integers that are multiples of 5 is closed under both addition and multiplication.  It is important to realize that the properties listed above depend on both the set and the operation(s). Statements such as Multiplication is commutative. or The positive integers are closed. are meaningless on their own. Naturally, if we have established a context in which the missing set or operation is clearly implied, then they would have meaning.   Operation Tables Operation Tables  If the set on which a binary operation is defined is small, a table is often a good way of describing the operation. For example, we might want to define on by The table for is   The top row and left column of an operation table are the column and row headings, respectively. To determine , find the entry in the row labeled and the column labeled . The following operation table serves to define on .   Note that , yet . Thus, is not commutative. Commutativity is easy to identify in a table: the table must be symmetric with respect to the diagonal going from the top left to lower right.    Exercises  Determine the properties that the following operations have on the positive integers.  addition  multiplication   defined by   defined by   defined by      Commutative, and associative.

The set of positive integers is closed under addition, and so is the set of negative integers, but . Therefore, their union, the nonzero integers, is not closed under addition.

  "body": " Algebraic Systems  Algebraic Systems   An algebraic system is a mathematical system consisting of a set called the domain and one or more operations on the domain. If is the domain and are the operations, denotes the mathematical system. If the context is clear, this notation is abbreviated to .   Monoids at Two Levels  Consider the following two examples of algebraic systems.   The concatenation of and Let be the set of all finite strings of 0's and 1's including the null (or empty) string, . An algebraic system is obtained by adding the operation of concatenation. The concatenation of two strings is simply the linking of the two strings together in the order indicated. The concatenation of strings with is denoted . For example, and . Note that concatenation is an associative operation and that is the identity for concatenation.  A note on notation: There isn't a standard symbol for concatenation. We have chosen to be consistent with the notation used in Python and Sage for the concatenation.  Let be any nonempty set and let * be any operation on that is associative and has an identity in . Any such system is called a monoid . We introduce monoids briefly here, but will discuss them further in   Our second example might seem strange, but we include it to illustrate a point. The algebraic system is a special case of . Most of us are much more comfortable with than with . No doubt, the reason is that the elements in are more concrete. We know what they look like and exactly how they are combined. The description of is so vague that we don't even know what the elements are, much less how they are combined. Why would anyone want to study ? The reason is related to this question: What theorems are of interest in an algebraic system? Answering this question is one of our main objectives in this chapter. Certain properties of algebraic systems are called algebraic properties, and any theorem that says something about the algebraic properties of a system would be of interest. The ability to identify what is algebraic and what isn't is one of the skills that you should learn from this chapter.  Now, back to the question of why we study . Our answer is to illustrate the usefulness of with a theorem about .  A Monoid Theorem  If , are elements of and , then .        The power of this theorem is that it can be applied to any algebraic system that describes. Since is one such system, we can apply to any two strings that commute. For example, 01 and 0101. Although a special case of this theorem could have been proven for , it would not have been any easier to prove, and it would not have given us any insight into other special cases of .  More Concrete Monoids Consider the set of real matrices, , with the operation of matrix multiplication. In this context, can be interpreted as saying that if , then . One pair of matrices that this theorem applies to is and .  For another pair of concrete monoids, we start with a universal set - although we could be a little less specific an imaging to be any nonempty set. The power set of with intersection, and the power set of with union are both monoids. What the identities of these monoids? Are they really the same monoid? We will answer this last question in .    Levels of Abstraction Levels of Abstraction   One of the fundamental tools in mathematics is abstraction. There are three levels of abstraction that we will identify for algebraic systems: concrete, axiomatic, and universal.   The Concrete Level  Almost all of the mathematics that you have done in the past was at the concrete level. As a rule, if you can give examples of a few typical elements of the domain and describe how the operations act on them, you are describing a concrete algebraic system. Two examples of concrete systems are and . A few others are:  The integers with addition. Of course, addition isn't the only standard operation that we could include. Technically, if we were to add multiplication, we would have a different system.  The subsets of the natural numbers, with union, intersection, and complementation.  The complex numbers with addition and multiplication.     The Axiomatic Level  The next level of abstraction is the axiomatic level. At this level, the elements of the domain are not specified, but certain axioms are stated about the number of operations and their properties. The system that we called is an axiomatic system. Some combinations of axioms are so common that a name is given to any algebraic system to which they apply. Any system with the properties of is called a monoid. The study of would be called monoid theory. The assumptions that we made about , associativity and the existence of an identity, are called the monoid axioms. One of your few brushes with the axiomatic level may have been in your elementary algebra course. Many algebra texts identify the properties of the real numbers with addition and multiplication as the field axioms. As we will see in Chapter 16, Rings and Fields, the real numbers share these axioms with other concrete systems, all of which are called fields.   The Universal Level  The final level of abstraction is the universal level. There are certain concepts, called universal algebra concepts, that can be applied to the study of all algebraic systems. Although a purely universal approach to algebra would be much too abstract for our purposes, defining concepts at this level should make it easier to organize the various algebraic theories in your own mind. In this chapter, we will consider the concepts of isomorphism, subsystem, and direct product.    Groups  To illustrate the axiomatic level and the universal concepts, we will consider yet another kind of axiomatic system, the group. In Chapter 5 we noted that the simplest equation in matrix algebra that we are often called upon to solve is , where and are known square matrices and is an unknown matrix. To solve this equation, we need the associative, identity, and inverse laws. We call the systems that have these properties groups.  Group  Group a group with elements and binary operation A group consists of a nonempty set and a binary operation on satisfying the properties   is associative on : for all .  There exists an identity element, , such that for all .  For all , there exists an inverse; that is, there exists such that .    A group is usually denoted by its set's name, , or occasionally by to emphasize the operation. At the concrete level, most sets have a standard operation associated with them that will form a group. As we will see below, the integers with addition is a group. Therefore, in group theory always stands for .  Generic Symbols At the axiomatic and universal levels, there are often symbols that have a special meaning attached to them. In group theory, the letter is used to denote the identity element of whatever group is being discussed. A little later, we will prove that the inverse of a group element, , is unique and its inverse is usually denoted and is read inverse. When a concrete group is discussed, these symbols are dropped in favor of concrete symbols. These concrete symbols may or may not be similar to the generic symbols. For example, the identity element of the group of integers is 0, and the inverse of is denoted by , the additive inverse of .  The asterisk could also be considered a generic symbol since it is used to denote operations on the axiomatic level.   Some concrete groups   The integers with addition is a group. We know that addition is associative. Zero is the identity for addition: for all integers . The additive inverse of any integer is obtained by negating it. Thus the inverse of is .  The integers with multiplication is not a group. Although multiplication is associative and 1 is the identity for multiplication, not all integers have a multiplicative inverse in . For example, the multiplicative inverse of 10 is , but is not an integer.  The power set of any set with the operation of symmetric difference, , is a group. If and are sets, then . We will leave it to the reader to prove that is associative over . The identity of the group is the empty set: . Every set is its own inverse since . Note that is not a group with union or intersection.    Abelian Group Abelian Group A group is abelian if its operation is commutative.  Abel Most of the groups that we will discuss in this book will be abelian. The term abelian is used to honor the Norwegian mathematician N. Abel (1802-29), who helped develop group theory.   Norwegian Stamp honoring Abel   Norwegian Stamp honoring Abel      Exercises  Discuss the analogy between the terms generic and concrete for algebraic systems and the terms generic and trade for prescription drugs. The terms generic and trade for prescription drugs are analogous to generic and concrete algebraic systems. Generic aspirin, for example, has no name, whereas Bayer, Tylenol, Bufferin, and Anacin are all trade or specific types of aspirins. The same can be said of a generic group where is a nonempty set and is a binary operation on , When examples of typical domain elements can be given along with descriptions of how operations act on them, such as * or , then the system is concrete (has a specific name, as with the aspirin). Generic is a way to describe a general algebraic system, whereas a concrete system has a name or symbols making it distinguishable from other systems.  Discuss the connection between groups and monoids. Is every monoid a group? Is every group a monoid?  Which of the following are groups?   with concatenation (see ).   with matrix addition.   with matrix multiplication.  The positive real numbers, , with multiplication.  The nonzero real numbers, , with multiplication.   with multiplication.  The positive integers with the operation defined by .   The systems in parts b, d, e, and f are groups.  Prove that, , defined by is an associative operation on .  The following problem supplies an example of a non-abelian group. A rook matrix is a matrix that has only 0's and 1's as entries such that each row has exactly one 1 and each column has exactly one 1. The term rook matrix is derived from the fact that each rook matrix represents the placement of rooks on an chessboard such that none of the rooks can attack one another. A rook in chess can move only vertically or horizontally, but not diagonally. Let be the set of rook matrices. There are six rook matrices:   List the rook matrices. They form a group, under matrix multiplication. Write out the multiplication table. Is the group abelian?  Write out the multiplication table for . This is another group. Is it abelian?  How many rook matrices are there? How many rook matrices are there?  Elements are , and , the group is abelian. Operation table is    This group is non-abelian since, for example, and .  4! = 24, .    For each of the following sets, identify the standard operation that results in a group. What is the identity of each group?  The set of all matrices with real entries and nonzero determinants.  The set of matrices with rational entries.     Let . Let be defined (partially) by for all . Write a complete table for so that is a group.  The identity is . , , , and is abelian. (This group is commonly called the Klein-4 group.)  Consider the following set of six algebraic expressions, each defining a function on the set of real numbers excluding the numbers 0 and 1. We can operate on any two of these expressions using function composition. For example, Therefore, . Complete the following operation table for function composition on .

  "body": " Some General Properties of Groups  Some General Properties of Groups  In this section, we will present some of the most basic theorems of group theory. Keep in mind that each of these theorems tells us something about every group. We will illustrate this point with concrete examples at the close of the section.   First Theorems  Identities are Unique The identity of a group is unique.  One difficulty that students often encounter is how to get started in proving a theorem like this. The difficulty is certainly not in the theorem's complexity. It's too terse! Before actually starting the proof, we rephrase the theorem so that the implication it states is clear.  Identities are Unique - Rephrased  If is a group and is an identity of , then no other element of is an identity of .  (Indirect): Suppose that , , and is an identity of . We will show that , which is a contradiction, completing the proof.   Next we justify the phrase ... the inverse of an element of a group.  Inverses are Unique  The inverse of any element of a group is unique.  The same problem is encountered here as in the previous theorem. We will leave it to the reader to rephrase this theorem. The proof is also left to the reader to write out in detail. Here is a hint: If and are both inverses of , then you can prove that . If you have difficulty with this proof, note that we have already proven it in a concrete setting in Chapter 5.  As mentioned above, the significance of is that we can refer to the inverse of an element without ambiguity. The notation for the inverse of is usually (note the exception below).  Some Inverses  In any group, is the inverse of the identity , which always is .   is the inverse of , which is always equal to (see below).   is the inverse of .  In a concrete group with an operation that is based on addition, the inverse of is usually written . For example, the inverse of in the group is written . In the group of matrices over the real numbers under matrix addition, the inverse of is written , which equals .    Inverse of Inverse Theorem  If a is an element of group , then .  Again, we rephrase the theorem to make it clear how to proceed.  Inverse of Inverse Theorem (Rephrased)  If has inverse and has inverse , then .       The next theorem gives us a formula for the inverse of . This formula should be familiar. In Chapter 5 we saw that if and are invertible matrices, then .  Inverse of a Product  If and are elements of group , then .  Let . We will prove that inverts . Since we know that the inverse is unique, we will have proved the theorem. Similarly, ; therefore,    Cancellation Laws  Cancellation in Groups  If , , and are elements of group , then   We will prove the left cancellation law. The right law can be proved in exactly the same way. Starting with , we can operate on both and on the left with : Applying the associative property to both sides we get    Linear Equations in a Group  Linear Equations in a Group  If is a group and , the equation has a unique solution, . In addition, the equation has a unique solution, .  We prove the theorem only for , since the second statement is proven identically. By the cancellation law, we can conclude that .  If and are two solutions of the equation , then and, by the cancellation law, . This verifies that is the only solution of .   Our proof of was analogous to solving the concrete equation in the following way: Therefore, by cancelling 4,   Exponents  If is an element of a group , then we establish the notation that In addition, we allow negative exponents and define, for example, Although this should be clear, proving exponentiation properties requires a more precise recursive definition.  Exponentiation in Groups  Exponentiation in Groups  For , define recursively by and if . Also, if , .  Some concrete exponentiations   In the group of positive real numbers with multiplication, and  In a group with addition, we use a different form of notation, reflecting the fact that in addition repeated terms are multiples, not powers. For example, in , is written as , is written as , etc. The inverse of a multiple of such as is written as .    Although we define, for example, , we need to be able to extract the single factor on the left. The following lemma justifies doing precisely that.   Let be a group. If and , then , and hence .  (By induction): If ,   Now assume the formula of the lemma is true for some .    Based on the definitions for exponentiation above, there are several properties that can be proven. They are all identical to the exponentiation properties from elementary algebra.  Properties of Exponentiation  If a is an element of a group , and and are integers,   and hence        We will leave the proofs of these properties to the reader. All three parts can be done by induction. For example the proof of the second part would start by defining the proposition , , to be . The basis is .    Our final theorem is the only one that contains a hypothesis about the group in question. The theorem only applies to finite groups.   If is a finite group, , and is an element of , then there exists a positive integer such that and .  Consider the list . Since there are elements of in this list, there must be some duplication. Suppose that , with . Let . Then Furthermore, since , .  Consider the concrete group . All of the theorems that we have stated in this section except for the last one say something about . Among the facts that we conclude from the theorems about are:  Since the inverse of 5 is , the inverse of is 5.  The inverse of is .  The solution of is .  .  (twenty-eight 3s).

On the basis of part a, describe a set of bijections on the set of integers.     is injective: .  is surjective: For all , has the solution .  Functions of the form , where is any integer, are bijections    Rephrase and write out a clear proof.  Prove by induction on that if , are elements of a group , , then . Interpret this result in terms of and .  Basis: ( ) by .  Induction: Assume that for some , We must show that  This can be accomplished as follows:   True or false? If , , are elements of a group , and , then . Explain your answer.  Prove . In this answer, we will refer to simply as the lemma.   Let be , where is any element of group . First we will prove that is true for all .  Basis: If , Using the definition of the zero exponent, , while . Therefore, is true.  Induction: Assume that for some , ) is true.

This result could either be written or . The latter form is how the division property is normally expressed in higher mathematics.   We now remind the reader of some interchangeable terminology that is used when , i. e., . All of the following say the same thing, just from slightly different points of view.   divides divides  multiple is a multiple of  factor is a factor of  divisor is a divisor of   We use the notation if divides .   For example and , but .  Caution: Don't confuse the divides symbol with the divided by symbol. The former is vertical while the latter is slanted. Notice however that the statement is related to the fact that is a whole number.  Greatest Common Divisor  Greatest Common Divisor ( )  the greatest common divisor of and Given two integers, and , not both zero, the greatest common divisor of and is the positive integer such that , , and   A little simpler way to think of is as the largest positive integer that is a divisor of both and . However, our definition is easier to apply in proving properties of greatest common divisors.  For small numbers, a simple way to determine the greatest common divisor is to use factorization. For example if we want the greatest common divisor of 660 and 350, you can factor the two integers: and . Single factors of 2 and 5 are the only ones that appear in both factorizations, so the greatest common divisor is .  Some pairs of integers have no common divisors other than 1. Such pairs are called relatively prime pairs .  Relatively Prime  Relatively Prime  A pair of integers, and , are relatively prime if  For example, and are relatively prime. Notice that neither 128 nor 135 are primes. In general, and need not be prime in order to be relatively prime. However, if you start with a prime, like 23, for example, it will be relatively prime to everything but its multiples. This theorem, which we prove later, generalizes this observation.   If is a prime and is any integer such that then   The Euclidean Algorithm Euclidean Algorithm, The  As early as Euclid's time it was known that factorization wasn't the best way to compute greatest common divisors.  The Euclidean Algorithm is based on the following properties of the greatest common divisor.  To compute , we divide into and get a remainder such that . By the property above, . We repeat the process until we get zero for a remainder. The last nonzero number that is the second entry in our pairs is the greatest common divisor. This is inevitable because the second number in each pair is smaller than the previous one. shows an example of how this calculation can be systematically performed.   A Table to Compute    - 99 53  1 53 46  1 46 7  6 7 4  1 4 3  1 3 1  3 1 0    Here is a Sage computation to verify that . At each line, the value of is divided by the value of . The quotient is placed on the next line along with the new value of , which is the previous ; and the remainder, which is the new value of . Recall that in Sage, a%b is the remainder when dividing b into a .   If you were allowed to pick two integers less than 100, which would you pick in order to force Euclid to work hardest? Here's a hint: The size of the quotient at each step determines how quickly the numbers decrease.  If quotient in division is 1, then we get the slowest possible completion. If , then working backwards, each remainder would be the sum of the two previous remainders. This described a sequence like the Fibonacci sequence and indeed, the greatest common divisor of two consecutive Fibonacci numbers will take the most steps to reach a final value of 1.   For fixed values of and , consider integers of the form where and can be any two integers. For example if = 36 and = 27, some of these results are tabulated below with values along the left column and the values on top.   Linear combinations of 36 and 27   Linear combinations of 36 and 27    Do you notice any patterns? What is the smallest positive value that you see in this table? How is it connected to 36 and 27?  Bézout's lemma Bézout's lemma  If and are positive integers, the smallest positive value of is the greatest common divisor of and , .  If , since and , we know that for any integers and , so can't be less than . To show that is exactly the least positive value, we show that can be attained by extending the Euclidean Algorithm. Performing the extended algorithm involves building a table of numbers. The way in which it is built maintains an invariant, and by , we can be sure that the desired values of and are produced.   To illustrate the algorithm, displays how to compute . In the column, you will find 152 and 53, and then the successive remainders from division. So each number in after the first two is the remainder after dividing the number immediately above it into the next number up. To the left of each remainder is the quotient from the division. In this case the third row of the table tells us that . The last nonzero value in is the greatest common divisor.   The extended Euclidean algorithm to compute    152 1 0  53 0 1  2 46 1  1 7 3  6 4 7  1 3 23  1 1 15  3 0 152    The and columns are new. The values of and in each row are maintained so that is equal to the number in the column. Notice that   Invariant in computing           The next-to-last equation is what we're looking for in the end! The main problem is to identify how to determine these values after the first two rows. The first two rows in these columns will always be the same. Let's look at the general case of computing . If the and values in rows and are correct, we have In addition, we know that If you substitute the expressions for and from (A) into this last equation and then collect the and terms separately you get or Look closely at the equations for . Their forms are all the same. With a little bit of practice you should be able to compute and values quickly.   Modular Arithmetic Modular Arithmetic  We remind you of the relation on the integers that we call . If two integers, and , differ by a multiple of , we say that they are congruent modulo , denoted . For example, because , which is a multiple of 5.  Modular Addition  Modular Addition  the mod sum of and  If is a positive integer, we define addition modulo  ) as follows. If ,   Modular Multiplication  Modular Multiplication  the mod product of and  If is a positive integer, we define multiplication modulo  ) as follows. If ,    The result of doing arithmetic modulo is always an integer between 0 and , by the Division Property. This observation implies that is closed under modulo arithmetic.  It is always true that and . For example, and .  We will use the notation to denote the set . One interpretation of this set is that each element is a representative of its equivalence class with respect to congruence modula . For example, if , the number in really represents all numbers in . In doing modular arithmetic, we can temporarily replace elements of with other elements in their equivalence class modulo .     Some Examples  We are all somewhat familiar with since the hours of the day are counted using this group, except for the fact that 12 is used in place of 0. Military time uses the mod 24 system and does begin at 0. If someone started a four-hour trip at hour 21, the time at which she would arrive is . If a satellite orbits the earth every four hours and starts its first orbit at hour 5, it would end its first orbit at time . Its tenth orbit would end at hours on the clock  Virtually all computers represent unsigned integers in binary form with a fixed number of digits. A very small computer might reserve seven bits to store the value of an integer. There are only different values that can be stored in seven bits. Since the smallest value is 0, represented as 0000000, the maximum value will be , represented as 1111111. When a command is given to add two integer values, and the two values have a sum of 128 or more, overflow occurs. For example, if we try to add 56 and 95, the sum is an eight-digit binary integer 10010111. One common procedure is to retain the seven lowest-ordered digits. The result of adding 56 and 95 would be . Integer arithmetic with this computer would actually be modulo 128 arithmetic.     Properties of Modular Arithmetic Modular Arithmetic Properties  Additive Inverses in  If , , then the additive inverse of a is . , since . Therefore, .  Addition modulo is always commutative and associative; 0 is the identity for and every element of has an additive inverse. These properties can be summarized by noting that for each , is a group.   The Additive Group of Integers Modulo  Integers Modulo Additive Group  The Additive Group of Integer Modulo   The Additive Group of Integers Modulo is the group with domain and with the operation of mod addition. It is denoted as .    Multiplication modulo is always commutative and associative, and 1 is the identity for .  Notice that the algebraic properties of and on are identical to the properties of addition and multiplication on .  Notice that a group cannot be formed from the whole set with mod multiplication since zero never has a multiplicative inverse. Depending on the value of there may be other restrictions. The following group will be explored in .   The Multiplicative Group of Integers Modulo  Integers Modulo Multiplicative Group  The Multiplicative Group of Integer Modulo   The Multiplicative Group of Integers Modulo is the group with domain and with the operation of mod multiplication. It is denoted as .    Some operation tables     Here are examples of operation tables for modular groups. Notice that although 8 is greater than 5, the two groups and both have order 4. In the case of , since 5 is prime all of the nonzero elements of are included. Since 8 isn't prime we don't include integers that share a common factor with 8, the even integers in this case.

Unlike the nice neat formula for additive inverses mod , multiplicative inverses can most easily computed by applying . If is an element of the group , then by definition , and so there exist integers and such that . They can be computed with the Extended Euclidean Algorithm. Since might not be in you might need take the remainder after dividing it by . Normally, that involves simply adding to .  For example, in , if we want the muliplicative inverse of , we run the Extended Euclidean Algorithm and find that Thus, the multiplicative inverse of 1001 is . See the SageMath Note below to see how to run the Extended Euclidean Algorithm.   SageMath Note - Modular Arithmetic SageMath Note Modular Arithmetic  Sage inherits the basic integer division functions from Python that compute a quotient and remainder in integer division. For example, here is how to divide 561 into 2017 and get the quotient and remainder.   In Sage, is the greatest common divisor function. It can be used in two ways. For the gcd of 2343 and 4319 we can evaluate the expression . If we are working with a fixed modulus that has a value established in your Sage session, the expression to compute the greatest common divisor of and any integer value . The extended Euclidean algorithm can also be called upon with :   Sage has some extremely powerful tool for working with groups. The integers modulo are represented by the expression and the addition and multiplications tables can be generated as follows.   Once we have assigned a value of , we can do calculations by wrapping around the integers 0 through 5. Here is a list containing the mod 6 sum and product, respectively, of 5 and 4:   Generating the multiplication table for the family of groups takes a bit more code. Here we restrict the allowed inputs to be integers from 2 to 64.

Subsystem  Subsystem  is a subsystem of  If is an algebraic system of a certain kind and is a subset of , then is a subsystem of if is an algebraic system of the same kind as . The usual notation for is a subsystem of is .   Since the definition of a subsystem is at the universal level, we can cite examples of the concept of subsystems at both the axiomatic and concrete level.  Examples of Subsystems   Subgroup (Axiomatic) If is a group, and is a subset of , then is a subgroup of if is a group.  (Concrete) is a subgroup of . Take the time now to write out the multiplication table of and convince yourself that is a group.  (Concrete) The even integers, is a subgroup of . Convince yourself of this fact.  (Concrete) The set of nonnegative integers is not a subgroup of . All of the group axioms are true for this subset except one: no positive integer has a positive additive inverse. Therefore, the inverse property is not true. Note that every group axiom must be true for a subset to be a subgroup.  (Axiomatic) If is a monoid and is a subset of , then is a submonoid of if is a monoid.  (Concrete) If is the set of strings of 0's and 1's of length zero or more with the operation of concatenation, then two examples of submonoids of are: (i) the set of strings of even length, and (ii) the set of strings that contain no 0's. The set of strings of length less than 50 is not a submonoid because it isn't closed under concatenation. Why isn't the set of strings of length 50 or more a submonoid of ?     Subgroups  For the remainder of this section, we will concentrate on the properties of subgroups. The first order of business is to establish a systematic way of determining whether a subset of a group is a subgroup.  Subgroup Conditions  Subgroup Conditions   To determine whether H, a subset of group , is a subgroup, it is sufficient to prove:  H is closed under ; that is, ;  H contains the identity element for ; and  H contains the inverse of each of its elements; that is, .     Our proof consists of verifying that if the three properties above are true, then all the axioms of a group are true for . By Condition (a), can be considered an operation on . The associative, identity, and inverse properties are the axioms that are needed. The identity and inverse properties are true by conditions (b) and (c), respectively, leaving only the associative property. Since, is a group, for all . Certainly, if this equation is true for all choices of three elements from , it will be true for all choices of three elements from , since is a subset of .  For every group with at least two elements, there are at least two subgroups: they are the whole group and . Since these two are automatic, they are not considered very interesting and are called the improper subgroups of the group; is sometimes referred to as the trivial subgroup. All other subgroups, if there are any, are called proper subgroups.  We can apply at both the concrete and axiomatic levels.  Applying Conditions for a Subgroup   (Concrete) We can verify that , as stated in . Whenever you want to discuss a subset, you must find some convenient way of describing its elements. An element of can be described as 2 times an integer; that is, is equivalent to . Now we can verify that the three conditions of are true for 2 . First, if , then there exist such that and . A common error is to write something like and . This would mean that , which is not necessarily true. That is why two different variables are needed to describe and . Returning to our proof, we can add and : . Since is an integer, is an element of . Second, the identity, , belongs to 2 ( ). Finally, if and , and , therefore, . By , . How would this argument change if you were asked to prove that ? or ?  (Concrete) We can prove that is a subgroup of . First, for each ordered pair , is in . This can be checked without too much trouble since . Thus we can conclude that is closed under . Second, . Third, , , , and . Therefore, the inverse of each element of is in .  (Axiomatic) If and are both subgroups of a group , then is a subgroup of . To justify this statement, we have no concrete information to work with, only the facts that and . Our proof that reflects this and is an exercise in applying the definitions of intersection and subgroup, (i) If and are elements of , then and both belong to , and since , must be an element of . Similarly, ; therefore, . (ii) The identity of must belong to both and ; hence it belongs to . (iii) If , then , and since , . Similarly, . Hence, by the theorem, . Now that this fact has been established, we can apply it to any pair of subgroups of any group. For example, since and are both subgroups of , is also a subgroup of . Note that if , must have a factor of 3; that is, there exists such that . In addition, must be even, therefore must be even. There exists such that , therefore . This shows that . The opposite containment can easily be established; therefore, .    Given a finite group, we can apply to obtain a simpler condition for a subset to be a subgroup.   Condition for a Subgroup of Finite Group  Given that is a finite group and is a nonempty subset of , if is closed under , then is a subgroup of .  In this proof, we demonstrate that Conditions (b) and (c) of follow from the closure of under , which is condition (a) of the theorem. First, select any element of ; call it . The powers of : , , are all in by the closure property. By , there exists , , such that ; hence . To prove that (c) is true, we let be any element of . If , then is in since . If , for some between 2 and and Therefore, , which belongs to since .    Sage Note - Applying the condition for a subgroup of a finite group  To determine whether and are subgroups of , we need only write out the addition tables (modulo 15) for these sets. This is easy to do with a bit of Sage code that we include below and then for any modulus and subset, we can generate the body of an addition table. The code is set up for but can be easily adjusted for .   Note that is a subgroup of . Since the interior of the addition table for contains elements that are outside of , is not a subgroup of .   Cyclic Subgroups  One kind of subgroup that merits special mention due to its simplicity is the cyclic subgroup.  Cyclic Subgroup  Cyclic Subgroup  Generator  the cyclic subgroup generated by  If is a group and , the cyclic subgroup generated by , , is the set of all powers of : . We refer to as a generator of subgroup .  A subgroup of a group is cyclic if there exists such that .   Cyclic Group  Cyclic Group  A group is cyclic if there exists such that .  If the operation on is additive, then .  Order of a Group Element  Order of a Group Element  Order of a  The order of an element of group is the number of elements in the cyclic subgroup of generated by . The order of is denoted .   In , .  In , . Here is why: If is finite, you need list only the positive powers (or multiples) of up to the first occurrence of the identity to obtain all of . In , the multiples of 6 are 6, , , , and . Note that is also , , and . This shows that a cyclic subgroup can have different generators.    If you want to list the cyclic subgroups of a group, the following theorem can save you some time.   If is an element of group , then .  This is an easy way of seeing, for example, that in equals , since .

  "body": " Direct Products  Direct Products  Definition  Our second universal algebraic concept lets us look in the opposite direction from subsystems. Direct products allow us to create larger systems. In the following definition, we avoid complicating the notation by not specifying how many operations the systems have.  Direct Product  Direct Product   The direct product of algebraic structures  If , are algebraic systems of the same kind, then the direct product of these systems is , with operations defined below. The elements of are -tuples of the form , where , . The systems , are called the factors of . There are as many operations on as there are in the factors. Each of these operations is defined componentwise:  If ,   A Direct Product of Monoids  Consider the monoids (the set of natural numbers with addition) and (the set of finite strings of 0's and 1's with concatenation). The direct product of with is a monoid. We illustrate its operation, which we will denote by , with examples: Note that our new monoid is not commutative. What is the identity for ?  The definiton of a is quite general and may be confusing to some. Here is the definiton of the direct product of two groups. The definition extends easily to the direct product of three or more groups.   Direct Product of Two Groups  Direct Product of Two Groups    The direct product of groups and    Let and be two groups. Their direct product is the system with domain equal to the Cartesian product of the domains of the two groups and with the coordinatewise operation defined by for .     Concurrent calculation in a direct product   Concurrent calculation in a direct product       On notation. If two or more consecutive factors in a direct product are identical, it is common to combine them using exponential notation. For example, can be written , and can be written . This is purely a notational convenience; no exponentiation is really taking place.  We call the operations in a direct product componentwise operations , and they are indeed operations on . If two -tuples, and , are selected from , the first components of and , and , are operated on with to obtain , the first component of . Note that since is an operation on , is an element of . Similarly, all other components of , as they are defined, belong to their proper sets.  One significant fact about componentwise operations is that the components of the result can all be computed at the same time (concurrently). The time required to compute in a direct product can be reduced to a length of time that is not much longer than the maximum amount of time needed to compute in the factors.  A direct product of algebraic systems is not always an algebraic system of the same type as its factors. This is due to the fact that certain axioms that are true for the factors may not be true for the set of -tuples. This situation does not occur with groups however. You will find that whenever a new type of algebraic system is introduced, call it type , one of the first theorems that is usually proven, if possible, is that the direct product of two or more systems of type is a system of type .      Direct Products of Groups  We will explore properties of direct products of groups and examine some concrete examples  The Direct Product of Groups is a Group  The direct product of two or more groups is a group; that is, the algebraic properties of a system obtained by taking the direct product of two or more groups includes the group axioms.   We will only present the proof of this theorem for the direct product of two groups. Some slight revisions can be made to produce a proof for any number of factors.  Stating that the direct product of two groups is a group is a short way of saying that if and are groups, then is also a group, where is the componentwise operation on . Associativity of : If , Notice how the associativity property hinges on the associativity in each factor. An identity for : As you might expect, if and are identities for and , respectively, then is the identity for . If , Similarly, .  Inverses in : The inverse of an element is determined componentwise . To verify, we compute : Similarly, .   Some New Groups   If , , the direct product of factors of , is a group with elements. We will take a closer look at . The elements of this group are triples of zeros and ones. Since the operation on is , we will use the symbol + for the operation on . Two of the eight triples in the group are and . Their sum is . One interesting fact about this group is that each element is its own inverse. For example ; therefore . We use the additive notation for the inverse of because we are using a form of addition. Note that is a subgroup of . Write out the addition table for this set and apply . The same can be said for any set consisting of (0, 0, 0) and another element of .   The direct product of the positive real numbers with the integers modulo 4, is an infinite group since one of its factors is infinite. The operations on the factors are multiplication and modular addition, so we will select the neutral symbol for the operation on . If and , then   It would be incorrect to say that is a subgroup of , but there is a subgroup of the direct product that closely resembles . It is . Its table is   Imagine erasing throughout the table and writing in place of . What would you get? We will explore this phenomenon in detail in the next section.  The whole direct product could be visualized as four parallel half-lines labeled 0, 1, 2, and 3 as in . On the th line, the point that lies units to the right of the zero mark would be . The set , which is depicted on the figure is a subgroup of . What cyclic subgroup is it?  The answer: or . There are two different generators.     Visualization of the group    Visualization of the group     A more conventional direct product is , the direct product of two factors of . The operation on is componentwise addition; hence we will use + as the operation symbol for this group. You should be familiar with this operation, since it is identical to addition of matrices. The Cartesian coordinate system can be used to visualize geometrically. We plot the pair on the plane in the usual way: units along the axis and units along the axis. There is a variety of different subgroups of , a few of which are:  , all of the points on the axis;   , all of the points that are on the line 2x - y = 0;  If , . The first two subgroups are special cases of this one, which represents any line that passes through the origin.   , a union of a set of lines that are parallel to .   , which is the only countable subgroup that we have listed.   We will leave it to the reader to verify that these sets are subgroups. We will only point out how the fourth example, call it , is closed under addition. If and and both belong to , then and , where both and are integers. We can determine whether belongs to by deciding whether or not is an integer: Since and are integers, so is . This completes a proof that is closed under the operation of .  Several useful facts can be stated in regards to the direct product of two or more groups. We will combine them into one theorem, which we will present with no proof. Parts a and c were derived for in the proof of .  Properties of Direct Products of Groups  If is a direct product of groups and , then:  The identity of is , where is the identity of .   .   for all .   is abelian if and only if each of the factors is abelian.  lf are subgroups of the corresponding factors, then is a subgroup of .      Not all subgroups of a direct product can be created using part e of . For example, is a subgroup of , but is not a direct product of two subgroups of .  Linked Lists using a Direct Product - XOR Linked Lists  XOR linked list  Using the identity , in , we can devise a scheme for representing a symmetrically linked list using only one link field. A symmetrically linked list is a list in which each node contains a pointer to its immediate successor and its immediate predecessor (see ). If the pointers are -digit binary addresses, then each pointer can be taken as an element of . Lists of this type can be accomplished using cells with only one link. In place of a left and a right pointer, the only link is the value of the sum (left link) + (right link). All standard list operations (merge, insert, delete, traverse, and so on) are possible with this structure, provided that you know the value of the nil pointer and the address, , of the first (i. e., leftmost) cell. Since first is nil, we can recover by adding the value of nil: , which is the address of the second item. Now if we temporarily retain the address, , of the second cell, we can recover the address of the third item. The link field of the second item contains the sum . Therefore   We no longer need the address of the first cell, only the second and third, to recover the fourth address, and so forth.   Symmetric Linked Lists   Symmetric Linked Lists    The following more formal algorithm uses names that reflects the timing of the visits.  Given a symmetric list, a traversal of the list is accomplished as follows, where is the address of the first cell. We presume that each item has some information that is represented by and a field called item.link that is the sum of the left and right links.    (1) yesterday =nil  (2) today =first  (3) while :  (3.1)Write(today.info)  (3.2)tomorrow = today.link + yesterday  (3.3)yesterday = today  (3.4)today = tomorrow.    At any point in this algorithm it would be quite easy to insert a cell between today and tomorrow. Can you describe how this would be accomplished?  This implementation of doubly linked lists is often referred to as an XOR linked list. For more information see the Wikipedia page .

  "body": " Isomorphisms  Isomorphisms  The following informal definition of isomorphic systems should be memorized. No matter how technical a discussion about isomorphic systems becomes, keep in mind that this is the essence of the concept.  Isomorphic Systems\/Isomorphism - Informal Version  Two algebraic systems are isomorphic if there exists a translation rule between them so that any true statement in one system can be translated to a true statement in the other.  How to Do Greek Arithmetic Imagine that you are a six-year-old child who has been reared in an English-speaking family, has moved to Greece, and has been enrolled in a Greek school. Suppose that your new teacher asks the class to do the following addition problem that has been written out in Greek. The natural thing for you to do is to take out your Greek-English\/English-Greek dictionary and translate the Greek words to English, as outlined in After you've solved the problem, you can consult the same dictionary to find the proper Greek word that the teacher wants. Although this is not the recommended method of learning a foreign language, it will surely yield the correct answer to the problem. Mathematically, we may say that the system of Greek integers with addition ( ) is isomorphic to English integers with addition (plus). The problem of translation between natural languages is more difficult than this though, because two complete natural languages are not isomorphic, or at least the isomorphism between them is not contained in a simple dictionary.   Solution of a Greek arithmetic problem   Solution of a Greek arithmetic problem     Software Implementation of Sets  In this example, we will describe how set variables can be implemented on a computer. We will describe the two systems first and then describe the isomorphism between them.  System 1: The power set of with the operation union, . For simplicity, we will only discuss union. However, the other operations are implemented in a similar way.  System 2: Strings of five bits of computer memory with an OR gate. Individual bit values are either zero or one, so the elements of this system can be visualized as sequences of five 0's and 1's. An OR gate, , is a small piece of computer hardware that accepts two bit values at any one time and outputs either a zero or one, depending on the inputs. The output of an OR gate is one, except when the two bit values that it accepts are both zero, in which case the output is zero. The operation on this system actually consists of sequentially inputting the values of two bit strings into the OR gate. The result will be a new string of five 0's and 1's. An alternate method of operating in this system is to use five OR gates and to input corresponding pairs of bits from the input strings into the gates concurrently.   Translation between sets and strings of bits   Translation between sets and strings of bits    The Isomorphism: Since each system has only one operation, it is clear that union and the OR gate translate into one another. The translation between sets and bit strings is easiest to describe by showing how to construct a set from a bit string. If , is a bit string in System 2, the set that it translates to contains the number if and only if equals 1. For example, is translated to the set , while the set is translated to Now imagine that your computer is like the child who knows English and must do a Greek problem. To execute a program that has code that includes the set expression , it will follow the same procedure as the child to obtain the result, as shown in .   Translation of a problem in set theory   Translation of a problem in set theory      Group Isomorphisms  Multiplying without doing multiplication  This isomorphism is between and . Until the 1970s, when the price of calculators dropped, multiplication and exponentiation were performed with an isomorphism between these systems. The isomorphism to ) between the two groups is that is translated into and any positive real number is translated to the logarithm of . To translate back from to , you invert the logarithm function. If base ten logarithms are used, an element of , , will be translated to . In pre-calculator days, the translation was done with a table of logarithms or with a slide rule. An example of how the isomorphism is used appears in .   Multiplication using logarithms   Multiplication using logarithms     The following definition of an isomorphism between two groups is a more formal one that appears in most abstract algebra texts. At first glance, it appears different, it is really a slight variation on the informal definition. It is the common definition because it is easy to apply; that is, given a function, this definition tells you what to do to determine whether that function is an isomorphism.  Group Isomorphism  Isomorphism Group  is isomorphic to  If and are groups, is an isomorphism from into if:   is a bijection, and   for all    If such a function exists, then we say is isomorphic to , denoted .   We should note that is isomorphic to is an equivalence relation on the set of all groups. We leave it to the reader to verify the following.  The identity function on a group is an isomorphism.  Bijections have inverses, the inverse of an isomorphism is an isomorphism.  The composition of any two isomorphisms that can be composed is an isomorphism.     Steps in proving that and are isomorphic   Steps in proving that and are isomorphic      There could be several different isomorphisms between the same pair of groups. Thus, if you are asked to demonstrate that two groups are isomorphic, your answer need not be unique.  Any application of this definition requires a procedure outlined in . The first condition, that an isomorphism be a bijection, reflects the fact that every true statement in the first group should have exactly one corresponding true statement in the second group. This is exactly why we run into difficulty in translating between two natural languages. To see how Condition (b) of the formal definition is consistent with the informal definition, consider the function defined by . The translation diagram between and for the multiplication problem appears in . We arrive at the same result by computing as we do by computing . If we apply the function to the two results, we get the same image: since . Note that is exactly Condition b of the formal definition applied to the two groups and .     General Multiplication using logarithms   General Multiplication using logarithms     Consider with matrix multiplication. The group is isomorphic to . Our translation rule is the function defined by . Since groups have only one operation, there is no need to state explicitly that addition is translated to matrix multiplication. That is a bijection is clear from its definition.  If and are any real numbers,   We can apply this translation rule to determine the inverse of a matrix in . We know that is a true statement in . Using to translate this statement, we get or therefore,   The next theorem summarizes some of the general facts about group isomorphisms that are used most often in applications. We leave the proof to the reader.  Properties of Isomorphisms  If and are groups with identities and , respectively, and is an isomorphism from into , then:     for all , and  If is a subgroup of , then is a subgroup of and is isomorphic to .    Is isomorphic to is an equivalence relation on the set of all groups. Therefore, the set of all groups is partitioned into equivalence classes, each equivalence class containing groups that are isomorphic to one another.   The order sequence of a finite group  Propp, Jim This topic is somewhat obscure. It doesn't appear in most texts, but is a nice companion to degree sequences in graph theory. Recall that every undirected graph has a degree sequence, and graphs with different degree sequences are not isomorphic. This is a convenient way to identify non-isomorphic graphs. We see below that order sequences play exactly the same role in identifying whether two finite groups are isomorphic. Furthermore, identical order sequences of two finite groups give an excellent set of hints for constructing an isomorphism, if one such exists. My colleague, Jim Propp, has been using this idea for a while in his classes and I discovered it later. Neither of us can claim originality. Much of the following discussion is paraphrased from Jim's notes.  Order Sequence Order Sequence  The order sequence of a finite group is the sequence whose terms are the respective orders of all the elements of the group, arranged in increasing order.   In the element 0 has order 1, the element 1 has order 3, and the element 2 has order 3, so the order sequence of this group is 1,3,3.  In the element 0 has order 1, the element 1 has order 4, the element 2 has order 2, and the element 3 has order 4, so the order sequence of this group is 1,2,4,4. (Note that we have arranged the numbers 1,4,2,4 in increasing order.)    If and are finite groups and is an isomorphism between them, with and , the order of in equals the order of in .   Consequently:  If two groups are isomorphic, they have the same order sequence.  The theorem is a handy tools for proving that two particular groups are not isomorphic. Consider the group ; the element has order 1 while the other elements , , and each have order 2, implying that the order sequence is 1,2,2,2. Since this is different from the sequence 1,2,4,4, the group is not isomorphic to the group .  Order sequences are also useful in helping one find isomorphisms. Consider the group (the set with mod-5 multiplication). Its order sequence is , which suggests that it might be isomorphic to . In fact, any isomorphism from to must map (the only element of order 1 in ) to (the only element of order 1 in ) and must map (the only element of order 2 in ) to (the only element of order 2 in ). There are only two bijections from to satisfying and , so these are the only two candidate isomorphisms (and both candidates turn out to be true isomorphisms).  The following code will compute the order sequence for the group of integers mod . The default value of is 12 and you can change it in the last line of input.    Conditions for groups to not be isomorphic  How do you decide that two groups are not isomorphic to one another? The negation of and are isomorphic is that no translation rule between and exists. If and have different cardinalities, then no bijection from into can exist. Hence they are not isomorphic. Given that , it is usually impractical to list all bijections from into and show that none of them satisfy Condition b of the formal definition. The best way to prove that two groups are not isomorphic is to find a true statement about one group that is not true about the other group. We illustrate this method in the following checklist that you can apply to most pairs of non-isomorphic groups in this book.  Assume that and are groups. The following are reasons for and to be not isomorphic.   and do not have the same cardinality. For example, can't be isomorphic to and can't be isomorphic to .   is abelian and is not abelian since is always true in , but would not always be true. We have seen two groups with six elements that apply here. They are and the group of rook matrices (see ). The second group is non-abelian, therefore it can't be isomorphic to .   has a certain kind of subgroup that doesn't have. Part (c) of states that this cannot happen if is isomorphic to . and are not isomorphic since has a subgroup with two elements, , while the proper subgroups of are all infinite (convince yourself of this fact!).  The number of solutions of in is not equal to the number of solutions of in . is not isomorphic to since has two solutions, 0 and 4, while is true for all . If the operation in is defined by a table, then the number of solutions of will be the number of occurrences of in the main diagonal of the table. The equations , can also be used in the same way to identify pairs of non-isomorphic groups.  One of the cyclic subgroups of equals (i. e., is cyclic), while none of 's cyclic subgroups equals (i. e., is noncyclic). This is a special case of Condition c. and are not isomorphic since and is not cyclic.     Exercises  State whether each pair of groups below is isomorphic. For each pair that is, give an isomorphism; for those that are not, give your reason.   and   and   and   with symmetric difference and   and   and with matrix addition   and    and the rook matrices   and       Yes, for is an isomorphism.

Prove that the number of 5's an order sequence is a multiple of four.    "

  "body": " Systems of Linear Equations  Systems of Linear Equations  Solutions  The method of solving systems of equations by matrices that we will look at is based on procedures involving equations that we are familiar with from previous mathematics courses. The main idea is to reduce a given system of equations to another simpler system that has the same solutions.  Solution Set  Solution Set  Given a system of equations involving real variables , , , the solution set of the system is the set of -tuples in , such that the substitutions , , make all the equations true.  In terms of logic, a solution set is a truth set of a system of equations, which is a proposition over -tuples of real numbers.  In general, if the variables are from a set , then the solution set will be a subset of . For example, in number theory mathematicians study Diophantine equations, where the variables can only take on integer values instead of real values.  Equivalent Systems of Equations  Two systems of linear equations are called equivalent if they have the same set of solutions.  Two equivalent systems The previous definition tells us that if we know that the system is equivalent to the system then both systems have the solution set . In other words, the simultaneous values , , and are the only values of the variables that make all three equations in either system true.   Elementary Operations on Equations  Elementary Operations on Equations  Elementary Operations on Equations   If any sequence of the following operations is performed on a system of equations, the resulting system is equivalent to the original system:  Interchange any two equations in the system.  Multiply both sides of any equation by a nonzero constant.  Multiply both sides of any equation by a nonzero constant and add the result to a second equation in the system, with the sum replacing the latter equation.     Let us now use the above theorem to work out the details of and see how we can arrive at the simpler system.  The original system:   Step 1. We will first change the coefficient of in the first equation to one and then use it as a pivot to obtain 0's for the coefficients of in Equations 2 and 3.  Multiply Equation 1 by to obtain   Multiply Equation 1 by and add the result to Equation 2 to obtain   Multiply Equation 1 by and add the result to Equation 3 to obtain    We've explicitly written terms with zero coefficients such as to make a point that all variables can be thought of as being involved in all equations. After this example is complete, we will discontinue this practice in favor of the normal practice of making these terms disappear.  Step 2. We would now like to proceed in a fashion analogous to Step 1; namely, multiply the coefficient of in the second equation by a suitable number so that the result is 1. Then use it as a pivot to obtain 0's as coefficients for in the first and third equations. This is clearly impossible (Why?), so we will first interchange Equations 2 and 3 and proceed as outlined above.  Exchange Equations 2 and 3 to obtain   Multiply Equation 2 by and subtract the result from Equation 1 to obtain    Step 3. Next, we will change the coefficient of in the third equation to one and then use it as a pivot to obtain 0's for the coefficients of in Equations 1 and 2. Notice that the coefficient of is already zero in Equation 1, so we have been saved some work!  Multiply Equation 3 by to obtain   Multiply Equation 3 by and add the result to Equation 2 to obtain    From the system of equations at the end of Step 3, we see that the solution to the original system is , , and .   Transition to Matrices  In the above sequence of steps, we note that the variables serve the sole purpose of keeping the coefficients in the appropriate location. This we can effect by using matrices. The matrix of the original system in our example is where the matrix of the first three columns is called the coefficient matrix and the complete matrix is referred to as the augmented matrix. Since we are now using matrices to solve the system, we will translate into matrix language.   Elementary Row Operations   Elementary Row Operations  Elementary Row Operations  If any sequence of the following operations is performed on the augmented matrix of a system of equations, the resulting matrix is a system that is equivalent to the original system. The following operations on a matrix are called elementary row operations:  Exchange any two rows of the matrix.  Multiply any row of the matrix by a nonzero constant.  Multiply any row of the matrix by a nonzero constant and add the result to a second row, with the sum replacing that second row.     Row Equivalent Matrices  Row Equivalent Matrices  Two matrices, and , are said to be row-equivalent if one can be obtained from the other by any sequence of zero or more elementary row operations.    If we use the notation to stand for Row of a matrix and to stand for row equivalence, then means that the matrix is obtained from the matrix by multiplying the Row of by and adding the result to Row . The operation of multiplying row by is indicated by while exchanging rows and is denoted by .  The matrix notation for the system given in our first example, with the subsequent steps, is: This again gives us the solution. This procedure is called the Gauss-Jordan elimination method .  It is important to remember when solving any system of equations via this or any similar approach that at any step in the procedure we can rewrite the matrix in equation format to help us to interpret the meaning of the augmented matrix.  In our first example we found a unique solution, only one triple, namely , which satisfies all three equations. For a system involving three unknowns, are there any other possible results? To answer this question, let's review some basic facts from analytic geometry.  The graph of a linear equation in three-dimensional space is a plane. So geometrically we can visualize the three linear equations as three planes in three-space. Certainly the three planes can intersect in a unique point, as in the first example, or two of the planes could be parallel. If two planes are parallel, there are no common points of intersection; that is, there are no triple of real numbers that will satisfy all three equations. Another possibility is that the three planes could intersect along a common axis or line. In this case, there would be an infinite number of real number triples in . Yet another possibility would be if the first two planes intersect in a line, but the line is parallel to, but not on, the third plane, giving us no solution. Finally if all three equations describe the same plane, the solution set would be that plane.  We can generalize these observations. In a system of linear equations, unknowns, there can be  a unique solution,  no solution, or  an infinite number of solutions.   To illustrate these points, consider the following examples:  A system with no solutions  Find all solutions to the system   The reader can verify that the augmented matrix of this system, , reduces to .  We can attempt to row-reduce this matrix further if we wish. However, any further row-reduction will not substantially change the last row, which, in equation form, is , or simply . It is clear that we cannot find real numbers , , and that will satisfy this equation. Hence we cannot find real numbers that will satisfy all three original equations simultaneously. When this occurs, we say that the system has no solution, or the solution set is empty.  A system with an infinite number of solutions Next, let's attempt to find all of the solutions to:  The augmented matrix for the system is which reduces to   If we apply additional elementary row operations to this matrix, it will only become more complicated. In particular, we cannot get a one in the third row, third column. Since the matrix is in simplest form, we will express it in equation format to help us determine the solution set. Any real numbers will satisfy the last equation. However, the first equation can be rewritten as , which describes the coordinate in terms of . Similarly, the second equation gives in terms of . A convenient way of listing the solutions of this system is to use set notation. If we call the solution set of the system , then .  What this means is that if we wanted to list all solutions, we would replace by all possible numbers. Clearly, there is an infinite number of solutions, two of which are and , when takes on the values 0 and 11, respectively.  A Word Of Caution: Frequently we may can get different-looking answers to the same problem when a system has an infinite number of solutions. Assume the solutions set in this example is reported to be . Certainly the result described by looks different from that described by . To see whether they indeed describe the same set, we wish to determine whether every solution produced in can be generated in . For example, the solution generated by when is . The same triple can be produced by by taking . We must prove that every solution described in is described in and, conversely, that every solution described in is described in . (See Exercise 6 of this section.)   To summarize the procedure in the Gauss-Jordan technique for solving systems of equations, we attempt to obtain 1's along the main diagonal of the coefficient matrix with 0's above and below the diagonal. We may find in attempting this that this objective cannot be completed, as in the last two examples we have seen. Depending on the way we interpret the results in equation form, we either recognize that no solution exists, or we identify free variables on which an infinite number of solutions are based. The final matrix forms that we have produced in our examples are referred to as echelon forms .  In practice, larger systems of linear equations are solved using computers. Generally, the Gauss-Jordan algorithm is the most useful; however, slight variations of this algorithm are also used. The different approaches share many of the same advantages and disadvantages. The two major concerns of all methods are:  minimizing inaccuracies due to round-off errors, and  minimizing computer time.     The Gauss-Jordan Algorithm  The accuracy of the Gauss-Jordan method can be improved by always choosing the element with the largest absolute value as the pivot element, as in the following algorithm.  The Gauss-Jordan Algorithm  Gauss-Jordan Algorithm  Given a matrix equation , where A is , let be the augmented matrix . The process of row-reducing to echelon form involves performing the following algorithm where is the row of .  i = 1  j = 1   while i <= n and j <= m) :  maxi=i  for k = i+1 to n:  if abs(C[k,j])>abs(C[maxi,j]) : then maxi=k  if C[maxi,j] != 0 then:  exchange rows i and maxi  divide each entry in row i by C[i,j]  for u = i+1 to n :  subtract C[u,j]*C[i] from C[u]  i = i+1    j=j+1        At the end of this algorithm, with the final form of you can revert back to the equation form of the system and a solution should be clear. In general,  If any row of is all zeros, it can be ignored.  If any row of has all zero entries except for the entry in the position, the system has no solution. Otherwise, if a column has no pivot, the variable corresponding to it is a free variable. Variables corresponding to pivots are basic variables and can be expressed in terms of the free variables.    If we apply to the system the augmented matrix is is reduced to Therefore, is a free variable in the solution and general solution of the system is   This conclusion is easy to see if you revert back to the equations that the final value the reduced matrix represents.     SageMath Note - Matrix Reduction  SageMath Note Matrix Reduction  Given an augmented matrix, , there is a matrix method called echelon_form that can be used to row reduce . Here is the result for the system in . In the assignment of a matrix value to , notice that the first argument is QQ, which indicates that the entries should be rational numbers. As long as all the entries are rational, which is the case here since integers are rational, the row-reduced matrix will be all rational.   If we don't specify the set from which entries are taken, it would assumed to be the integers and we do not get a fully row-reduced matrix. This is because the next step in working with the next output would involve multiplying row 2 by and row 3 by , but these multipliers are not integers.   If we specifying real entries, the result isn't as nice and clean as the rational output.   The default number of decimal places may vary from what you see here, but it can be controlled. The single small number in row three column four isn't exactly zero because of round-off but we could just set it to zero.

We noted that not all matrices have inverses, but when the inverse of a matrix exists, it is unique. This enables us to define the inverse of an matrix as the unique matrix such that , where is the identity matrix. In order to get some practical experience, we developed a formula that allowed us to determine the inverse of invertible matrices. We will now use the Gauss-Jordan procedure for solving systems of linear equations to compute the inverses, when they exist, of matrices, . The following procedure for a matrix can be generalized for matrices, .  Given the matrix , we want to find its inverse, the matrix , if it exists, such that and . We will concentrate on finding a matrix that satisfies the first equation and then verify that B also satisfies the second equation.  The equation is equivalent to  By definition of equality of matrices, this gives us three systems of equations to solve. The augmented matrix of one of the systems, the one equating the first columns of the two matrices is:  Using the Gauss-Jordan algorithm, we have: So and , which gives us the first column of .  The matrix form of the system to obtain , , and , the second column of B, is: which reduces to The critical thing to note here is that the coefficient matrix in is the same as the matrix in , hence the sequence of row operations that we used in row reduction are the same in both cases.  To determine the third column of , we reduce to obtain and . Here again it is important to note that the sequence of row operations used to solve this system is exactly the same as those we used in the first system. Why not save ourselves a considerable amount of time and effort and solve all three systems simultaneously? This we can do this by augmenting the coefficient matrix by the identity matrix . We then have, by applying the same sequence of row operations as above, So that The reader should verify that so that .   The General Method for Computing Inverses  As the following theorem indicates, the verification that is not necessary. The proof of the theorem is beyond the scope of this text. The interested reader can find it in most linear algebra texts.   Let be an matrix. If a matrix can be found such that , then , so that . In fact, to find , we need only find a matrix that satisfies one of the two conditions or .  It is clear from Chapter 5 and our discussions in this chapter that not all matrices have inverses. How do we determine whether a matrix has an inverse using this method? The answer is quite simple: the technique we developed to compute inverses is a matrix approach to solving several systems of equations simultaneously.

  "body": " An Introduction to Vector Spaces  Vector Spaces  Motivation for the study of vector spaces   When we encountered various types of matrices in Chapter 5, it became apparent that a particular kind of matrix, the diagonal matrix, was much easier to use in computations. For example, if , then can be found, but its computation is tedious. If then Even when presented with a non-diagonal matrix, we will see that it is sometimes possible to do a bit of work to be able to work with a diagonal matrix. This process is called diagonalization .  In a variety of applications it is beneficial to be able to diagonalize a matrix. In this section we will investigate what this means and consider a few applications. In order to understand when the diagonalization process can be performed, it is necessary to develop several of the underlying concepts of linear algebra.   Vector Spaces  By now, you realize that mathematicians tend to generalize. Once we have found a good thing, something that is useful, we apply it to as many different concepts as possible. In doing so, we frequently find that the different concepts are not really different but only look different. Four sentences in four different languages might look dissimilar, but when they are translated into a common language, they might very well express the exact same idea.  Early in the development of mathematics, the concept of a vector led to a variety of applications in physics and engineering. We can certainly picture vectors, or arrows, in the and even in the three-dimensional space. Does it make sense to talk about vectors in four-dimensional space, in ten-dimensional space, or in any other mathematical situation? If so, what is the essence of a vector? Is it its shape or the rules it follows? The shape in two- or three-space is just a picture, or geometric interpretation, of a vector. The essence is the rules, or properties, we wish vectors to follow so we can manipulate them algebraically. What follows is a definition of what is called a vector space. It is a list of all the essential properties of vectors, and it is the basic definition of the branch of mathematics called linear algebra.  Vector Space Vector Space  Let be any nonempty set of objects. Define on an operation, called addition, for any two elements , and denote this operation by . Let scalar multiplication be defined for a real number and any element and denote this operation by . The set together with operations of addition and scalar multiplication is called a vector space over if the following hold for all , and :      There exists a vector , such that for all .  For each vector , there exists a unique vector , such that .  These are the main properties associated with the operation of addition. They can be summarized by saying that is an abelian group.  The next four properties are associated with the operation of scalar multiplication and how it relates to vector addition.           .    In a vector space it is common to call the elements of vectors and those from scalars. Vector spaces over the real numbers are also called real vector spaces.  A Vector Space of Matrices Let and let the operations of addition and scalar multiplication be the usual operations of addition and scalar multiplication on matrices. Then together with these operations is a real vector space. The reader is strongly encouraged to verify the definition for this example before proceeding further (see Exercise 3 of this section). Note we can call the elements of vectors even though they are not arrows.  The Vector Space Let . If we define addition and scalar multiplication the natural way, that is, as we would on matrices, then is a vector space over . See of this section.  In this example, we have the bonus that we can illustrate the algebraic concept geometrically. In mathematics, a geometric bonus does not always occur and is not necessary for the development or application of the concept. However, geometric illustrations are quite useful in helping us understand concepts and should be utilized whenever available.   Sum of two vectors in    Sum of two vectors in    Let's consider some illustrations of the vector space . Let and . We illustrate the vector as a directed line segment, or arrow, from the point to the point . The vectors and are as shown in together with . The vector is a vector in the same direction as , but with twice its length.    The common convention is to use that boldface letters toward the end of the alphabet for vectors, while letters early in the alphabet are scalars.  A common alternate notation for vectors is to place an arrow about a variable to indicate that it is a vector such as this: .  The vector is referred to as an -tuple.  For those familiar with vector calculus, we are expressing the vector as . This allows us to discuss vectors in in much simpler notation.     In many situations a vector space is given and we would like to describe the whole vector space by the smallest number of essential reference vectors. An example of this is the description of , the -plane, via the and axes. Again our concepts must be algebraic in nature so we are not restricted solely to geometric considerations.  Linear Combination Linear Combination. A vector in vector space (over ) is a linear combination of the vectors , , if there exist scalars in such that   A Basic Example The vector in is a linear combination of the vectors and since .  A little less obvious example  Prove that the vector is a linear combination of the vectors (3, 1) and (1, 4).  By the definition we must show that there exist scalars and such that: This system has the solution , .  Hence, if we replace and both by 1, then the two vectors (3, 1) and (1, 4) produce, or generate, the vector (4,5). Of course, if we replace and by different scalars, we can generate more vectors from . If, for example, and , then   Will the vectors and generate any vector we choose in ? To see if this is so, we let be an arbitrary vector in and see if we can always find scalars and such that . This is equivalent to solving the following system of equations: which always has solutions for and , regardless of the values of the real numbers and . Why? We formalize this situation in a definition:  Generation of a Vector Space  Generate Span  Let be a set of vectors in a vector space over . This set is said to generate , or span, if, for any given vector , we can always find scalars , , such that . A set that generates a vector space is called a generating set .  We now give a geometric interpretation of the previous examples.  We know that the standard coordinate system, axis and axis, were introduced in basic algebra in order to describe all points in the -plane algebraically. It is also quite clear that to describe any point in the plane we need exactly two axes.  We can set up a new coordinate system in the following way. Draw the vector and an axis from the origin through (3, 1) and label it the axis. Also draw the vector and an axis from the origin through to be labeled the axis. Draw the coordinate grid for the axis, that is, lines parallel, and let the unit lengths of this new plane be the lengths of the respective vectors, and , so that we obtain .  From and , we see that any vector on the plane can be described using the standard -axes or our new -axes. Hence the position which had the name in reference to the standard axes has the name with respect to the axes, or, in the phraseology of linear algebra, the coordinates of the point with respect to the axes are .   Two sets of axes for the plane   Two sets of axes for the plane    One point, Two position descriptions From we found that if we choose and , then the two vectors and generate the vector . Another geometric interpretation of this problem is that the coordinates of the position with respect to the axes of is . In other words, a position in the plane has the name in reference to the -axes and the same position has the name in reference to the axes.  From the above, it is clear that we can use different axes to describe points or vectors in the plane. No matter what choice we use, we want to be able to describe each position in a unique manner. This is not the case in . Any point in the plane could be described via the axes, the axes or the axes. Therefore, in this case, a single point would have three different names, a very confusing situation.   Three axes on a plane   Three axes on a plane     We formalize the our observations in the previous examples in two definitions and a theorem.   Linear Independence\/Linear Dependence  Linear Independence  Linear Dependence  A set of vectors from a real vector space is linearly independent if the only solution to the equation is . Otherwise the set is called a linearly dependent set.   Basis  Basis  A set of vectors is a basis for a vector space if:  generates , and  is linearly independent.    The fundamental property of a basis  If is a basis for a vector space V over , then any vector can be uniquely expressed as a linear combination of the .   Assume that is a basis for over . We must prove two facts:  each vector can be expressed as a linear combination of the , and  each such expression is unique.    Part 1 is trivial since a basis, by its definition, must generate all of .  The proof of part 2 is a bit more difficult. We follow the standard approach for any uniqueness facts. Let be any vector in and assume that there are two different ways of expressing , namely and where at least one is different from the corresponding . Then equating these two linear combinations we get so that  Now a crucial observation: since the form a linearly independent set, the only solution to the previous equation is that each of the coefficients must equal zero, so for . Hence , for all . This contradicts our assumption that at least one is different from the corresponding , so each vector can be expressed in one and only one way.   This theorem, together with the previous examples, gives us a clear insight into the significance of linear independence, namely uniqueness in representing any vector.  Another basis for Prove that is a basis for over and explain what this means geometrically.  First we show that the vectors and generate all of . We can do this by imitating and leave it to the reader (see of this section). Secondly, we must prove that the set is linearly independent.  Let and be scalars such that . We must prove that the only solution to the equation is that and must both equal zero. The above equation becomes which gives us the system The augmented matrix of this system reduces in such way that the only solution is the trivial one of all zeros: Therefore, the set is linearly independent.   To explain the results geometrically, note through Exercise 12, part a, that the coordinates of each vector can be determined uniquely using the vectors (1,1) and (-1, 1). The concept of dimension is quite obvious for those vector spaces that have an immediate geometric interpretation. For example, the dimension of is two and that of is three. How can we define the concept of dimension algebraically so that the resulting definition correlates with that of and ? First we need a theorem, which we will state without proof.  Basis Size is Constant   If is a vector space with a basis containing elements, then all bases of contain elements.  Dimension of a Vector Space  Dimension of a Vector Space  The dimension of vector space  Let be a vector space over with basis . Then the dimension of is . We use the notation to indicate that is -dimensional.    Exercises   If , , , , and verify that all properties of the definition of a vector space are true for with these values.   Let , , , ,and .

The solution set of the equation is Therefore, all eigenvectors of associated with the eigenvalue are of the form , where can be any nonzero number.  The following theorems summarize the most important aspects of the previous example.  Characterization of Eigenvalues of a Square Matrix  Let be any matrix over . Then is an eigenvalue of if and only if .   The equation is called the characteristic equation , and the left side of this equation is called the characteristic polynomial of .  Linear Independence of Eigenvectors  Nonzero eigenvectors corresponding to distinct eigenvalues are linearly independent.  The solution space of is called the eigenspace of corresponding to . This terminology is justified by Exercise 2 of this section.   Diagonalization  We now consider the main aim of this section. Given an (square) matrix , we would like to transform into a diagonal matrix , perform our tasks with the simpler matrix , and then describe the results in terms of the given matrix .   Diagonalizable Matrix  Diagonalizable Matrix  An matrix is called diagonalizable if there exists an invertible matrix such that is a diagonal matrix . The matrix is said to diagonalize the matrix .   Diagonalization of a Matrix  We will now diagonalize the matrix of . We form the matrix as follows: Let be the first column of . Choose for any eigenvector from . We may as well choose a simple vector in so is our candidate.  Similarly, let be the second column of , and choose for any eigenvector from . The vector is a reasonable choice, thus so that Notice that the elements on the main diagonal of are the eigenvalues of , where is the eigenvalue corresponding to the eigenvector .   The first step in the diagonalization process is the determination of the eigenvalues. The ordering of the eigenvalues is purely arbitrary. If we designate and , the columns of would be interchanged and would be (see Exercise 3b of this section). Nonetheless, the final outcome of the application to which we are applying the diagonalization process would be the same.  If is an matrix with distinct eigenvalues, then is also an matrix whose columns , , are linearly independent vectors.     Diagonalization of a 3 by 3 matrix Diagonalize the matrix .  First, we find the eigenvalues of . Hence, the equation becomes Therefore, our eigenvalues for are and . We note that we do not have three distinct eigenvalues, but we proceed as in the previous example.  Case 1. For the equation becomes We can row reduce the matrix of coefficients to .  The matrix equation is then equivalent to the equations . Therefore, the solution set, or eigenspace, corresponding to consists of vectors of the form   Therefore is an eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue , and can be used for our first column of :   Before we continue we make the observation: is a subspace of with basis and .  Case 2. If , then the equation becomes   Without the aid of any computer technology, it should be clear that all three equations that correspond to this matrix equation are equivalent to , or . Notice that can take on any value, so any vector of the form will solve the matrix equation.  We note that the solution set contains two independent variables, and . Further, note that we cannot express the eigenspace as a linear combination of a single vector as in Case 1. However, it can be written as   We can replace any vector in a basis is with a nonzero multiple of that vector. Simply for aesthetic reasons, we will multiply the second vector that generates by 2. Therefore, the eigenspace is a subspace of with basis and so .  What this means with respect to the diagonalization process is that gives us both Column 2 and Column 3 the diagonalizing matrix. The order is not important so we have  The reader can verify (see Exercise 5 of this section) that and   In doing , the given matrix produced only two, not three, distinct eigenvalues, yet we were still able to diagonalize . The reason we were able to do so was because we were able to find three linearly independent eigenvectors. Again, the main idea is to produce a matrix that does the diagonalizing. If is an matrix, will be an matrix, and its columns must be linearly independent eigenvectors. The main question in the study of diagonalizability is When can it be done? This is summarized in the following theorem.  A condition for diagonalizability Let be an matrix. Then is diagonalizable if and only if has linearly independent eigenvectors.  Outline of a proof: ( ) Assume that has linearly independent eigenvectors, , with corresponding eigenvalues , , . We want to prove that is diagonalizable. Column of the matrix is (see Exercise 7 of this section). Then, since the is an eigenvector of associated with the eigenvalue we have for . But this means that , where is the diagonal matrix with diagonal entries , , . If we multiply both sides of the equation by we get the desired .  ( ) The proof in this direction involves a concept that is not covered in this text (rank of a matrix); so we refer the interested reader to virtually any linear algebra text for a proof.  We now give an example of a matrix that is not diagonalizable.   A Matrix that is Not Diagonalizable  Let us attempt to diagonalize the matrix  First, we determine the eigenvalues. Therefore there are two eigenvalues, and . Since is an eigenvalue of degree one, it will have an eigenspace of dimension 1. Since is a double root of the characteristic equation, the dimension of its eigenspace must be 2 in order to be able to diagonalize.  Case 1. For , the equation becomes   Row reduction of this system reveals one free variable and eigenspace Hence, is a basis for the eigenspace of .  Case 2. For , the equation becomes   Once again there is only one free variable in the row reduction and so the dimension of the eigenspace will be one: Hence, is a basis for the eigenspace of . This means that produces only one column for . Since we began with only two eigenvalues, we had hoped that would produce a vector space of dimension two, or, in matrix terms, two linearly independent columns for . Since does not have three linearly independent eigenvectors cannot be diagonalized.   SageMath Note - Diagonalization  SageMath Note Matrix Diagonalization  We demonstrate how diagonalization can be done in Sage. We start by defining the matrix to be diagonalized, and also declare and to be variables.   We have been working with right eigenvectors since the in is a column vector. It's not so common but still desirable in some situations to consider left eigenvectors, so SageMath allows either one. The right_eigenmatrix method returns a pair of matrices. The diagonal matrix, , with eigenvalues and the diagonalizing matrix, , which is made up of columns that are eigenvectors corresponding to the eigenvectors of .   We should note here that is not unique because even if an eigenspace has dimension one, any nonzero vector in that space will serve as an eigenvector. For that reason, the generated by Sage isn't necessarily the same as the one computed by any other computer algebra system such as Mathematica. Here we verify the result for our Sage calculation. Recall that an asterisk is used for matrix multiplication in Sage.   Here is a second matrix to diagonalize.   Here we've already specified that the underlying system is the rational numbers. Since the eigenvalues are not rational, Sage will revert to approximate number by default. We'll just pull out the matrix of eigenvectors this time and display rounded entries.   Finally, we examine how Sage reacts to the matrix from that couldn't be diagonalized. Notice that the last column is a zero column, indicating the absence of one needed eigenvector.     Exercises  List three different eigenvectors of , the matrix of , associated with each of the two eigenvalues 1 and 4. Verify your results.  Choose one of the three eigenvectors corresponding to 1 and one of the three eigenvectors corresponding to 4, and show that the two chosen vectors are linearly independent.     Any nonzero multiple of is an eigenvector associated with .  Any nonzero multiple of is an eigenvector associated with .  Let and .

These applications can be found in science, the social sciences, economics, engineering, and, many other areas where mathematics is used. We will consider a few diverse examples the mathematics behind these applications here.   Diagonalization  We begin by developing a helpful technique for computing , . If can be diagonalized, then there is a matrix such that , where is a diagonal matrix and   The proof of this identity was an exercise in Section 5.4. The condition that be a diagonal matrix is not necessary but when it is, the calculation on the right side is particularly easy to perform. Although the formal proof is done by induction, the reason why it is true is easily seen by writing out an example such as :   Application to Recursion: Matrix Computation of the Fibonnaci Sequence  Fibonacci Sequence Matrix Representation  Consider the computation of terms of the Fibonnaci Sequence. Recall that and for .  In order to formulate the calculation in matrix form, we introduced the dummy equation  so that now we have two equations If , these two equations can be expressed in matrix form as We can use induction to prove that if ,   Next, by diagonalizing and using the fact that . we can show that   Some comments on this example:  An equation of the form , where and are given constants, is referred to as a linear homogeneous second-order difference equation. The conditions and , where and are constants, are called initial conditions. Those of you who are familiar with differential equations may recognize that this language parallels what is used in differential equations. Difference (aka recurrence) equations move forward discretely; that is, in a finite number of positive steps. On the other hand, a differential equation moves continuously; that is, takes an infinite number of infinitesimal steps.  A recurrence relationship of the form , where and are constants, is called a first-order difference equation. In order to write out the sequence, we need to know one initial condition. Equations of this type can be solved similarly to the method outlined in the example by introducing the superfluous equation to obtain in matrix equation:      Path Counting  In the next example, we apply the following theorem, which can be proven by induction.  Path Counting Theorem If is the adjacency matrix of a graph with vertices , then the entry is the number of paths of length from node to node .   Counting Paths with Diagonalization  Consider the graph in .   Counting Numbers of Paths   Counting Numbers of Paths    As we saw in Section 6.4, the adjacency matrix of this graph is .  Recall that is the adjacency matrix of the relation , where is the relation of the above graph. Also recall that in computing , we used Boolean arithmetic. What happens if we use regular arithmetic? If we square we get   How can we interpret this? We note that and that there are two paths of length two from (the third node) to . Also, , and there is one path of length 2 from to . The reader should verify these claims by examining the graph.  How do we compute for possibly large values of ? From the discussion at the beginning of this section, we know that if is diagonalizable. We leave to the reader to show that are eigenvalues of with eigenvectors   Then where and   See of this section for the completion of this example.    Matrix Calculus  Matrix Calculus - Exponentials  Those who have studied calculus recall that the Maclaurin series is a useful way of expressing many common functions. For example, . Indeed, calculators and computers use these series for calculations. Given a polynomial , we defined the matrix-polynomial for square matrices in Chapter 5. Hence, we are in a position to describe for an matrix as a limit of polynomials, the partial sums of the series. Formally, we write   Again we encounter the need to compute high powers of a matrix. Let be an diagonalizable matrix. Then there exists an invertible matrix such that , a diagonal matrix, so that   The infinite sum in the middle of this final expression can be easily evaluated if is diagonal. All entries of powers off the diagonal are zero and the entry of the diagonal is  For example, if , the first matrix we diagonalized in Section 12.3, we found that and .  Therefore,    Many of the ideas of calculus can be developed using matrices. For example, if then  Many of the basic formulas in calculus are true in matrix calculus. For example, and if is a constant matrix, Matrix calculus can be used to solve systems of differential equations in a similar manner to the procedure used in ordinary differential equations.

Difference (aka recurrence) equations move forward discretely; that is, in a finite number of positive steps. On the other hand, a differential equation moves continuously; that is, takes an infinite number of infinitesimal steps.  A recurrence relationship of the form , where and are constants, is called a first-order difference equation. In order to write out the sequence, we need to know one initial condition. Equations of this type can be solved similarly to the method outlined in the example by introducing the superfluous equation to obtain in matrix equation:    "

  "body": " Linear Equations over the Integers Mod 2  Linear Equations over the Integers Mod 2   Row reduction mod 2  The methods we have studied for solving systems of equations up to this point can be applied to systems in which all arithmetic is done over other algebraic systems, including the integers modulo 2. The mod 2 case will become particularly useful in our later study of coding theory.  When solving systems of equations with mod 2 arithmetic, the elementary row operations are still fundamental. However, since there is only one nonzero element, 1, you never need to multiply a row by a nonzero constant. One other big difference is that the number of possible solutions is always finite. If you have linear equations in unknowns, each unknown can only take on one of two values, 0 or 1. Therefore there are only possible -tuples to from which to draw a solution set. Assuming , you typically (but not always) will have basic variables after row-reduction and free variable. If this is the case, and any solution exists, there will be different solutions.  Let's look at an example, which is coverted to matrix form immediately.   The augmented matrix of the system is The steps in row-reducing this matrix follow. Entries on which we pivot are displayed in bold face to more easily identify the basic variables.   Notice that at this point, we cannot pivot on the third row, third column since that entry is zero. Therefore we move over to the next column, making the basic.   This completes the row reduction and we can now identify the solution set. Keep in mind that since addition is subtraction, terms can be moved to either side of an equals sign without any change in sign. The basic variables are , , and , while the other three variables are free. The general solution of the system is   With three free variables, there are solutions to this system. For example, one of them is obtained by setting , , and , which produces .  We can check our row reduction with SageMath:     Exercises  In all of the exercises that follow, the systems of equations are over , and so mod 2 arithmetic should be used in solving them.  Solve the following systems, describing the solution sets completely:               This exercise provides an example in which the number of basic variables is less than the number of equations. The only difference between the two systems below is the right hand sides. You can start with an augmented matrix having two right side columns and do row reduction for both systems at the same time.          As suggested here is the augmented matrix with both right sides, and its row reduction: There are only two basic variables here because the left side of the last equation is the sum of the left sides of the first two equations.  Ignoring the last column of both matrices, we see that the last equation of the first system reduces to , which is always true, and the first two equations yield two free variables, and . The general solution is the set of quadruples . The cardinality of the solution set is 4.  If we replace the fifth column with the sixth one, the last row indicates that , which means that the solution set is empty.     This exercise motivates the concept of a coset in Chapter 15.  Solve the following system and prove that the solution set is a linear combination of vectors in and also a subgroup of the group under coordinatewise mod 2 addition.   Describe the solution set to the following system as it relates to the solution set to the system in the previous part of this exercise.

  "body": " Lattices  Lattices  In this section, we restrict our discussion to lattices, those posets for which every pair of elements has both a greatest lower bound and least upper bound. We first introduce some notation.  Join, Meet  Join  Meet  the join, or least upper bound of and  the meet, or greatest lower bound of and  Let be a poset, and . We define:   , read join , as the least upper bound of and , if it exists. and   , read meet , as the greatest lower bound of and , if it exists.    Since the join and meet produce a unique result in all cases where they exist, by , we can consider them as binary operations on a set if they always exist. Thus the following definition:  Lattice  Lattice  A lattice with domain having meet and join operations  A lattice is a poset for which every pair of elements has a greatest lower bound and least upper bound. Since a lattice is an algebraic system with binary operations and , it is denoted by . If we want to make it clear what partial ordering the lattice is based on, we say it is a lattice under .

Thus, we have a lattice in this case; and and . The reader is encouraged to write out the operation tables .  Our first concrete lattice can be generalized to the case of any set , producing the lattice , where the join operation is the set operation of union and the meet operation is the operation intersection; that is, and .  It can be shown (see the exercises) that the commutative laws, associative laws, idempotent laws, and absorption laws are all true for any lattice. A concrete example of this is clearly , since these laws hold in the algebra of sets. This lattice also has distributive property in that join is distributive over meet and meet is distributive over join. However, this is not always the case for lattices in general.  Distributive Lattice  Distributive Lattice  Let be a lattice under . is called a distributive lattice if and only if the distributive laws hold; that is, for all we have   A Nondistributive Lattice  We now give an example of a lattice where the distributive laws do not hold.

  "body": " Boolean Algebras  Boolean Algebras  In order to define a Boolean algebra, we need the additional concept of complementation. A lattice must have both a greatest element and a least element in order for complementation to take place. The following definition will save us some words in the rest of this section.  Bounded Lattice  Bounded Lattice  A bounded lattice is a lattice that contains both a least element and a greatest element.  We use the symbols and for the least and greatest elements of a bounded lattice in the remainder of this section.  The Complement of a Lattice Element  Complement of a Lattice Element  Let be a bounded lattice. If , then has a complement if there exists such that   Notice that by the commutative laws for lattices, if complements , then complements .  Complemented Lattice  Complemented Lattice  Let be a bounded lattice. is a complemented lattice if every element of has a complement in .  Set Complement is a Complement In Chapter 1, we defined the complement of a subset of any universe. This turns out to be a concrete example of the general concept we have just defined, but we will reason through why this is the case here. Let , where . Then is a bounded lattice with and . To find the complement, if it exists, of , for example, we want such that It's not too difficult to see that , since we need to include to make the first condition true and can't include or if the second condition is to be true. Of course this is precisely how we defined in Chapter 1. Since it can be shown that each element of has a complement (see Exercise 1), is a complemented lattice. Note that if is any set and , then is a complemented lattice where the complement of is .  In , we observed that the complement of each element of is unique. Is this always true in a complemented lattice? The answer is no. Consider the following.  A Lattice for which complements are not unique Let and consider the lattice (under divides ). The least element of is 1 and the greatest element is 30. Let us compute the complement of the element . We want to determine such that and . Certainly, works, but so does , so the complement of in this lattice is not unique. However, is still a complemented lattice since each element does have at least one complement.   Complementation as an operation  Complement of a Lattice Element as an operation  The complement of lattice element  If a complemented lattice has the property that the complement of every element is unique, then we consider complementation to be a unary operation. The usual notation for the complement of is .    The following theorem gives us an insight into when uniqueness of complements occurs.   One condition for unique complements  If is a complemented, distributive lattice, then the complement of each element is unique.  Let and assume to the contrary that has two complements, namely and . Then by the definition of complement, .  Then On the other hand, Hence , which contradicts the assumption that has two different complements.  Boolean Algebra  Boolean Algebra  a boolean algebra with operations join, meet and complementation  A Boolean algebra is a lattice that contains a least element and a greatest element and that is both complemented and distributive. The notation is used to denote the boolean algebra with operations join, meet and complementation.  Since the complement of each element in a Boolean algebra is unique (by ), complementation is a valid unary operation over the set under discussion, which is why we will list it together with the other two operations to emphasize that we are discussing a set together with three operations. Also, to help emphasize the distinction between lattices and lattices that are Boolean algebras, we will use the letter as the generic symbol for the set of a Boolean algebra; that is, will stand for a general Boolean algebra.  Boolean Algebra of Sets Let be any set, and let . Then is a Boolean algebra. Here, stands for the complement of an element of with respect to , .  This is a key example for us since all finite Boolean algebras and many infinite Boolean algebras look like this example for some . In fact, a glance at the basic Boolean algebra laws in , in comparison with the set laws of Chapter 4 and the basic laws of logic of Chapter 3, indicates that all three systems behave the same; that is, they are isomorphic.  Divisors of 30 A somewhat less standard example of a boolean algebra is derived from the lattice of divisors of 30 under the relation divides . If you examine the ordering diagram for this lattice, you see that it is structurally the same as the boolean algebra of subsets of a three element set. Therefore, the join, meet and complementation operations act the same as union, intersection and set complementation. We might conjecture that the lattice of divisors of any integer will produce a boolean algebra, but it is only the case of certain integers. Try out a few integers to see if you can identify what is necessary to produce a boolean algebra.   Basic Boolean Algebra Laws   Commutative Laws     Associative Laws     Distributive Laws     Identity Laws     Complement Laws     Idempotent Laws     Null Laws     Absorption Laws     DeMorgan's Laws     Involution Law      The pairings of the boolean algebra laws reminds us of the principle of duality, which we state for a Boolean algebra.

  "body": " Atoms of a Boolean Algebra  In this section we will look more closely at something we've hinted at, which is that every finite Boolean algebra is isomorphic to an algebra of sets. We will show that every finite Boolean algebra has elements for some with precisely generators, called atoms.  Consider the Boolean algebra , whose ordering diagram is depicted in   Illustration of the atom concept   Illustration of the atom concept    We note that , , , and ; that is, each of the elements above level one can be described completely and uniquely in terms of the elements on level one. The 's have uniquely generated the non-least elements of much like a basis in linear algebra generates the elements in a vector space. We also note that the 's are the immediate successors of the minimum element, 0. In any Boolean algebra, the immediate successors of the minimum element are called atoms . For example, let be any nonempty set. In the Boolean algebra (over ), the singleton sets are the generators, or atoms, of the algebraic structure since each element can be described completely and uniquely as the join, or union, of singleton sets.  Atom  Atom of a Boolean Algebra  A non-least element in a Boolean algebra is called an atom if for every , or .  The condition that tells us that is a successor of ; that is, , as depicted in (a)  The condition is true only when and are not connected. This occurs when is another atom or if is a successor of atoms different from , as depicted in (b).   Conditions for an atom   Conditions for an atom    An alternate definition of an atom is based on the concept of covering.  The Covering Relation  covering relation  Given a Boolean algebra , let . We say that  covers  iff and there does not exist with .  It can be proven that the atoms of Boolean algebra are precisely those elements that cover the zero element.  The set of atoms of the Boolean algebra is . To see that is an atom, let be any non-least element of and note that one of the two conditions or holds. Of course, to apply the definition to this Boolean algebra, we must remind ourselves that in this case the 0-element is 1, the operation is greatest common divisor, and the poset relation is divides. So if , we have (or ), so Condition 1 holds. If , the first condition is not true. (Why?) However, Condition 2, , is true. The reader is encouraged to show that 3 and 5 also satisfy the definition of an atom. Next, if we should compute the join (the least common multiple in this case) of all possible combinations of the atoms 2, 3, and 5 to generate all nonzero (non-1 in this case) elements of . For example, and . We state this concept formally in the following theorem, which we give without proof.   Let be any finite Boolean algebra. Let be the set of all atoms of . Then every element in can be expressed uniquely as the join of a subset of .  The least element in relation to this theorem bears noting. If we consider the empty set of atoms, we would consider the join of elements in the empty set to be the least element. This makes the statement of the theorem above a bit more tidy since we don't need to qualify what elements can be generated from atoms.  We now ask ourselves if we can be more definitive about the structure of different Boolean algebras of a given order. Certainly, the Boolean algebras and have the same graph (that of ), the same number of atoms, and, in all respects, look the same except for the names of the elements and the operations. In fact, when we apply corresponding operations to corresponding elements, we obtain corresponding results. We know from Chapter 11 that this means that the two structures are isomorphic as Boolean algebras. Furthermore, the graphs of these examples are exactly the same as that of , which is an arbitrary Boolean algebra of order .  In these examples of a Boolean algebra of order 8, we note that each had 3 atoms and number of elements, and all were isomorphic to , where . This leads us to the following questions:  Are there any different (nonisomorphic) Boolean algebras of order 8?  What is the relationship, if any, between finite Boolean algebras and their atoms?  How many different (nonisomorphic) Boolean algebras are there of order 2? Order 3? Order 4? etc.    The answers to these questions are given in the following theorem and corollaries.   Let be any finite Boolean algebra, and let A be the set of all atoms of . Then is isomorphic to    An isomorphism that serves to prove this theorem is defined by , where is interpreted as the zero of . We leave it to the reader to prove that this is indeed an isomorphism.   Every finite Boolean algebra has elements for some positive integer .  Let be the set of all atoms of and let . Then there are exactly elements (subsets) in ,and by , is isomorphic to and must also have elements.   All Boolean algebras of order are isomorphic to one another.    Isomorphisms to be combined   Isomorphism to be combined    Every Boolean algebra of order is isomorphic to when . Hence, if and each have elements, they each have atoms. Suppose their sets of atoms are and , respectively. We know there are isomorphisms and , where , . In addition we have an isomorphism, from into , which we ask you to prove in . We can combine these isomorphisms to produce the isomorphism , which proves the corollary.  The above theorem and corollaries tell us that we can only have finite Boolean algebras of orders , and that all finite Boolean algebras of any given order are isomorphic. These are powerful tools in determining the structure of finite Boolean algebras. In the next section, we will discuss one of the easiest ways of describing a Boolean algebra of any given order.

We can therefore completely describe every finite Boolean algebra by the algebra of power sets. Is there a more convenient, or at least an alternate way, of defining finite Boolean algebras? In Chapter 11 we found that we could produce new groups by taking Cartesian products of previously known groups. We imitate this process for Boolean algebras.  The simplest nontrivial Boolean algebra is the Boolean algebra on the set . The ordering on is the natural one, . If we treat 0 and 1 as the truth values false and true, respectively, we see that the Boolean operations and are nothing more than the logical operation with the same symbols. The Boolean operation, , (complementation) is the logical (negation). In fact, this is why these symbols were chosen as the names of the Boolean operations. The operation tables for are simply those of or,  and, and not, which we repeat here.   By and its corollaries, all Boolean algebras of order 2 are isomorphic to this one.  We know that if we form we obtain the set , a set of order 4. We define operations on the natural way, namely componentwise, so that , and .

Since all Boolean algebras of order 4 are isomorphic to one other, we have found a simple way of describing all Boolean algebras of order 4.

This procedure has considerable application to the simplification of circuits in switching theory or logical design.   Boolean Expression  Boolean Expression  Let be any Boolean algebra, and let be variables in ; that is, variables that can assume values from . A Boolean expression generated by is any valid combination of the and the elements of with the operations of meet, join, and complementation.    This definition is the analog of the definition of a proposition generated by a set of propositions, presented in Section 3.2.  Each Boolean expression generated by variables, , defines a function where . If is a finite Boolean algebra, then there are a finite number of functions from into . Those functions that are defined in terms of Boolean expressions are called Boolean functions. As we will see, there is an infinite number of Boolean expressions that define each Boolean function. Naturally, the shortest of these expressions will be preferred. Since electronic circuits can be described as Boolean functions with , this economization is quite useful.  In what follows, we make use of in Section 7.1 for counting number of functions.  Two variables over  Consider any Boolean algebra of order 2, . How many functions are there? First, all Boolean algebras of order 2 are isomorphic to so we want to determine the number of functions . If we consider a Boolean function of two variables, and , we note that each variable has two possible values 0 and 1, so there are ways of assigning these two values to the variables. Hence, the table below has rows. So far we have a table such as this one:   How many possible different functions can there be? To list a few: , , , , , etc. Each of these will fill in the question marks in the table above. The tables for and are   Two functions are different if and only if their tables are different for at least one row. Of course by using the basic laws of Boolean algebra we can see that . Why? So if we simply list by brute force all combinations of we will obtain unnecessary duplication. However, we note that for any combination of the variables , and there are only two possible values for , namely 0 or 1. Thus, we could write different functions on 2 variables.   Now, let's count the number of different Boolean functions in a more general setting. We will consider two cases: first, when , and second, when is any finite Boolean algebra with elements.  Let . Each function is defined in terms of a table having rows. Therefore, since there are two possible images for each element of , there are 2 raised to the , or different functions. We will show that every one of these functions is a Boolean function.  Now suppose that . A function from into can still be defined in terms of a table. There are rows to each table and possible images for each row. Therefore, there are raised to the power different functions. We will show that if , not every one of these functions is a Boolean function.  Since all Boolean algebras are isomorphic to a Boolean algebra of sets, the analogues of statements in sets are useful in Boolean algebras.  Minterm  Minterm  the minterm generated by , where if and if  A Boolean expression generated by that has the form where each may be either or is called a minterm generated by . We use the notation for the minterm generated by , where if and if   An example of the notation is that .  By a direct application of the Rule of Products we see that there are different minterms generated by .  Minterm Normal Form  Minterm Normal Form  A Boolean expression generated by is in minterm normal form if it is the join of expressions of the form , where and is a minterm generated by . That is, it is of the form where , and are the minterms generated by .    We seem to require every minterm generated by , in , and we really do. However, some of the values of can be , which effectively makes the corresponding minterm disappear.  If , then each in a minterm normal form is either 0 or 1. Therefore, is either 0 or .    Uniqueness of Minterm Normal Form  Let be a Boolean expression over B. There exists a unique minterm normal form that is equivalent to in the sense that e and M define the same function from into .  The uniqueness in this theorem does not include the possible ordering of the minterms in (commonly referred to as uniqueness up to the order of minterms ). The proof of this theorem would be quite lengthy, and not very instructive, so we will leave it to the interested reader to attempt. The implications of the theorem are very interesting, however.  If , then there are raised to the different minterm normal forms. Since each different minterm normal form defines a different function, there are a like number of Boolean functions from into . If , there are as many Boolean functions (2 raised to the ) as there are functions from into , since there are raised to the functions from into . The significance of this result is that any desired function can be realized using electronic circuits having 0 or 1 (off or on, positive or negative) values.  More complex, multivalued circuits corresponding to boolean algebras with more than two values would not have this flexibility because of the number of minterm normal forms, and hence the number of boolean functions, is strictly less than the number of functions.

  "title": "A Brief Introduction to Switching Theory and Logic Design",
  "body": " A Brief Introduction to Switching Theory and Logic Design  Switching Theory  Logic Design  Disclaimer : I'm still looking for a good application for drawing logic gates. The figures here are quite rough.  Early computers relied on many switches to perform the logical operations needed for computation. This was true as late as the 1970's when early personal computers such as the Altair ( ) started to appear. Pioneering computer scientists such as Claude Shannon realized that the operation of these computers could be simplified by making use of an isomorphism between computer circuits and boolean algebra. The term Switching Theory was used at the time. Logical gates realized through increasingly smaller and smaller integrated circuits still perform the same functions as in early computers, but using purely electronic means. In this section, we give examples of some switching circuits. Soon afterward, we will transition to the more modern form of circuits that are studied in Logic Design , where gates replace switches. Our main goal is to give you an overview of how boolean functions corresponds to any such circuit. We will introduce the common system notation used in logic design and show how it corresponds with the mathematical notation of Boolean algebras. Any computer scientist should be familiar with both systems.   The Altair Computer, an early PC, by Todd Dailey, Creative Commons   Image of an Altair computer from https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Altair_8800#\/media\/File:Altair_8800_at_the_Computer_History_Museum,_cropped.jpg at the Computer History Museum    The simplest switching device is the on-off switch. If the switch is closed\/ON, current will pass through it; if it is open\/OFF, current will not pass through it. If we designate ON by 1, and OFF by 0, we can describe electrical circuits containing switches by Boolean expressions with the variables representing the variable states of switches or the variable bits passing through gates.  The electronics involved in these switches take into account whether we are negating a switch or not. For electromagnetic switches, a magnet is used to control whether the switch is open or closed. The magnets themselves may be controlled by simple ON\/OFF switches. There are two types of electromagnetic switches. One is normally open (OFF) when the magnet is not activated, but activating the magnet will close the circuit and the switch is then ON. A separate type of switch corresponds with a negated switch. For that type, the switch is closed when the magnet is not activated, and when the magnet is activated, the switch opens. We won't be overly concerned with the details of these switches or the electronics corresponding to logical gates. We will simply assume they are available to plug into a circuit. For simplicity, we use the inversion symbol on a variable that labels a switch to indicate that it is a switch of the second type, as in .  Standby power generators that many people have in their homes use a transfer switch to connect the generator to the home power system. This switch is open (OFF) if there is power coming from the normal municipal power supply. It stays OFF because a magnet is keeping it open. When power is lost, the magnet is no longer activated, and the switch closes and is ON. So the transfer switch is a normally ON switch.    Representation of a normally OFF switch controlled by variable    Representation of a normally OFF switch     Representation of a normally ON switch controlled by variable    Representation of a normally ON switch     The standard notation used for Boolean algebra operations in switching theory and logic design is for join, instead of ; and for meet, instead of . Complementation is the same in both notational systems, denoted with an overline.  The expression represents the situation in which a series of two switches appears in sequence as in . In order for current to flow through the circuit, both switches must be ON; that is, they must both have the value 1. Similarly, a pair of parallel switches, as in , is described algebraically by . Here, current flows through this part of the circuit as long as at least on of the switches is ON.    Two switches in AND configuration realizing    Two switches in AND configuration      Two switches in OR configuration realizing    Two switches in OR configuration     All laws and concepts developed previously for Boolean algebras hold. The only change is purely notational. We make the change in this section solely to introduce the reader to another frequently used system of notation.  Many of the laws of Boolean algebra can be visualized thought switching theory. For example, the distributive law of meet over join is expressed as The switching circuit analogue of the above statement is that the circuits in the two images below are equivalent. In circuit (b), the presence of two 's might represent two electromagnetic switches controlled by the same magnet.    (a)   The first of equivalent switching circuits     (b)   The second of equivalent switching circuits     The circuits in a computer are now composed of large quantities of gates, which serve the same purpose as switches, but can be miniaturized to a great degree. For example, the OR gate, usually drawn as in implements the logical OR function. This happens electronically, but is equivalent to . The AND gate, which is equivalent to two sequential switches is shown in .    An OR gate   An OR gate     An AND gate   An AND gate     The complementation process is represented in a gate diagram by an inverter, as pictured in .   Inverter, or NOT gate   Inverter     When drawing more complex circuits, multiple AND's or OR's are sometimes depicted using a more general gate drawing. For example if we want to depict an OR gate with three inputs that is ON as long as at least one input is ON, we would draw it as in , although this would really be two binary gates, as in . Both diagrams are realizing the boolean expression . Strictly speaking, the gates in represent , but the associative law for join tells us that the grouping doesn't matter.    Simple version of a ternary OR gate   Simple version of a ternary OR gate     A ternary OR gate created with binary OR gates   A ternary OR gate created with binary OR gates     In , we show a few other commonly used gates, XOR, NAND, and NOR, which correspond to the boolean exressions , , and , respectively.   Other common gates   Other common gates that represent XOR, NAND, and NOR     Let's start with a logic circuit and see how the laws of boolean algebra can help us simplify it.  Simplification of a circuit  Consider the circuit in . As usual, we assume that three inputs enter on the left and the output exits on the right.   Initial gate diagram   Initial gate diagram    If we trace the inputs through the gates we see that this circuit realizes the boolean function   We simplify the boolean expression that defines , simplifying the circuit in so doing. You should be able to identify the laws of Boolean algebra that are used in each of the steps. See . Therefore, , which can be realized with the much simpler circuit in , without using the input .   Simplified gate diagram   Simplified gate diagram     Next, we start with a table of desired outputs based on three bits of input and design an efficient circuit to realize this output.   Consider the following table of desired outputs for the three input bits .   Desired output table    0 0 0 0  0 0 1 1  0 1 0 0  0 1 1 0  1 0 0 1  1 0 1 1  1 1 0 0  1 1 1 0    The first step is to write the of . Since we are working with the two value Boolean algebra, , the constants in each minterm are either 0 or 1, and we simply list the minterms that have a 1. These correspond with the rows of the table above that have an output of 1. We will then attempt to simplify the expression as much as possible.     Therefore we can realize our table with the boolean function . A circuit diagram for this function is . But is this the simplest circuit that realizes the table? See .   A realization of the table of desired outputs.

  "body": " Free Monoids and Languages  Free Monoids and Languages  In this section, we will introduce the concept of a language. Languages are subsets of a certain type of monoid, the free monoid over an alphabet. After defining a free monoid, we will discuss languages and some of the basic problems relating to them. We will also discuss the common ways in which languages are defined.  Let be a nonempty set, which we will call an alphabet. Our primary interest will be in the case where is finite; however, could be infinite for most of the situations that we will describe. The elements of are called letters or symbols. Among the alphabets that we will use are , and the set of ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) characters, which we symbolize as .  Strings over an Alphabet  Strings over an Alphabet  The set of all strings over an alphabet  The set of all strings of length over an alphabet  The empty string  A string of length , over alphabet is a sequence of letters from : . The null string, , is defined as the string of length zero containing no letters. The set of strings of length over is denoted by . The set of all strings over is denoted .    If the length of string is , we write .  The null string is not the same as the empty set, although they are similar in many ways. .  ; that is, is a partition of .  An element of can appear any number of times in a string.      If is countable, then is countable.  Case 1. Given the alphabet , we can define a bijection from the positive integers into . Each positive integer has a binary expansion , where each is 0 or 1 and . If has such a binary expansion, then . We define by where . Every one of the strings of length are the images of exactly one of the integers between From its definition, is clearly a bijection; therefore, is countable.  Case 2: is Finite. We will describe how this case is handled with an example first and then give the general proof. If , then we can code the letters in into strings from . One of the coding schemes (there are many) is . Now every string in corresponds to a different string in ; for example, . would correspond with . The cardinality of is equal to the cardinality of the set of strings that can be obtained from this encoding system. The possible coded strings must be countable, since they are a subset of a countable set, . Therefore, is countable.  If , then the letters in can be coded using a set of fixed-length strings from . If , then there are at least as many strings of length in as there are letters in . Now we can associate each letter in with with a different element of . Then any string in . corresponds to a string in . By the same reasoning as in the example above, is countable.  Case 3: is Countably Infinite. We will leave this case as an exercise.  Concatenation  Concatenation  The concatenation of strings and  Let and be strings of length and , respectively. The concatenation of with , , is the string of length .  There are several symbols that are used for concatenation. We chose to use the one that is also used in Python and SageMath.   The set of strings over any alphabet is a monoid under concatenation.     The null string is the identity element of . Henceforth, we will denote the monoid of strings over by .  Concatenation is noncommutative, provided .  If , then the monoids and are isomorphic. An isomorphism can be defined using any bijection . If , defines a bijection from into . We will leave it to the reader to prove that for all .     The languages of the world, English, German, Russian, Chinese, and so forth, are called natural languages. In order to communicate in writing in any one of them, you must first know the letters of the alphabet and then know how to combine the letters in meaningful ways. A formal language is an abstraction of this situation.   Formal Language  Formal Language  If is an alphabet, a formal language over is a subset of .  Some Formal Languages   English can be thought of as a language over of letters , both upper and lower case, and other special symbols, such as punctuation marks and the blank. Exactly what subset of the strings over this alphabet defines the English language is difficult to pin down exactly. This is a characteristic of natural languages that we try to avoid with formal languages.  The set of all ASCII stream files can be defined in terms of a language over ASCII. An ASCII stream file is a sequence of zero or more lines followed by an end-of-file symbol. A line is defined as a sequence of ASCII characters that ends with the a new line character. The end-of-file symbol is system-dependent.  The set of all syntactically correct expressions in any computer language is a language over the set of ASCII strings.  A few languages over are      = the submonoid of generated by .     Two Fundamental Problems: Recognition and Generation  The generation and recognition problems are basic to computer programming. Given a language, , the programmer must know how to write (or generate) a syntactically correct program that solves a problem. On the other hand, the compiler must be written to recognize whether a program contains any syntax errors.   The Recognition Problem  Recognition Problem  Given a formal language over alphabet , the Recognition Problem is to design an algorithm that determines the truth of in a finite number of steps for all . Any such algorithm is called a recognition algorithm.   Recursive Language  Recursive Language  A language is recursive if there exists a recognition algorithm for it.  Some Recursive Languages   The language of syntactically correct propositions over set of propositional variables expressions is recursive.  The three languages in (d) are all recursive. Recognition algorithms for and should be easy for you to imagine. The reason a recognition algorithm for might not be obvious is that the definition of is more cryptic. It doesn't tell us what belongs to , just what can be used to create strings in . This is how many languages are defined. With a second description of , we can easily design a recognition algorithm. You can prove that .     The Generation Problem  Generation Problem  Design an algorithm that generates or produces any string in . Here we presume that is either finite or countably infinite; hence, is countable by , and must be countable. Therefore, the generation of amounts to creating a list of strings in . The list may be either finite or infinite, and you must be able to show that every string in appears somewhere in the list.  Recursive implies Generating   If is countable, then there exists a generating algorithm for .  If is a recursive language over a countable alphabet, then there exists a generating algorithm for .      Part (a) follows from the fact that is countable; therefore, there exists a complete list of strings in .  To generate all strings of , start with a list of all strings in and an empty list, , of strings in . For each string , use a recognition algorithm (one exists since is recursive) to determine whether . If , add it to ; otherwise throw it out. Then go to the next string in the list of .  Since all of the languages in (d) are recursive, they must have generating algorithms. The one given in the proof of is not usually the most efficient. You could probably design more efficient generating algorithms for and ; however, a better generating algorithm for is not quite so obvious.  The recognition and generation problems can vary in difficulty depending on how a language is defined and what sort of algorithms we allow ourselves to use. This is not to say that the means by which a language is defined determines whether it is recursive. It just means that the truth of the statement is recursive may be more difficult to determine with one definition than with another. We will close this section with a discussion of grammars, which are standard forms of definition for a language. When we restrict ourselves to only certain types of algorithms, we can affect our ability to determine whether is true. In defining a recursive language, we do not restrict ourselves in any way in regard to the type of algorithm that will be used. In the next section, we will consider machines called finite automata, which can only perform simple algorithms.  One common way of defining a language is by means of a phrase structure grammar (or grammar, for short). The set of strings that can be produced using set of grammar rules is called a phrase structure language.  Zeros before Ones We can define the set of all strings over for which all 0's precede all 1's as follows. Define the starting symbol and establish rules that can be replaced with any of the following: , , or . These replacement rules are usually called production rules. They are usually written in the format , , and . Now define to be the set of all strings that can be produced by starting with and applying the production rules until no longer appears. The strings in are exactly the ones that are described above.  Phrase Structure Grammar  Phrase Structure Grammar  Language created by phrase structure grammar  A phrase structure grammar consists of four components:  A nonempty finite set of terminal characters, . If the grammar is defining a language over , is a subset of .  A finite set of nonterminal characters, .  A starting symbol, .  A finite set of production rules, each of the form , where and are strings over such that and contains at least one nonterminal symbol.    If is a phrase structure grammar, is the set of strings that can be produced by starting with and applying the production rules a finite number of times until no nonterminal characters remain. If a language can be defined by a phrase structure grammar, then it is called a phrase structure language.    Alternating bits language The language over consisting of strings of alternating 0's and 1's is a phrase structure language. It can be defined by the following grammar:  Terminal characters: , , and  Nonterminal characters: , , and  Starting symbol:  Production rules:     These rules can be visualized with a graph:   Production rules for the language of alternating 0's and 1's   Production rules for the language of alternating 0's and 1's    We can verify that a string such as 10101 belongs to the language by starting with and producing 10101 using the production rules a finite number of times: .  Valid SageMath Variables Let be the grammar with components:  Terminal symbols = all letters of the alphabet (both upper and lower case), digits 0 through 9, and underscore  Nonterminal symbols: ,  Starting symbol:  Production rules: , where is any letter, for any letter , for any letter, digit or underscore, , and for any letter, digit or underscore, . There are a total of production rules for this grammar. The language consists of all valid SageMath variable names.   Backus-Naur Form  Backus-Naur form (BNF) is a popular alternate form of defining the production rules in a grammar. If the production rules are part of a grammar, they would be written in BNF as . The symbol in BNF is read as or while the is read as is defined as. Additional notations of BNF are that , represents zero or more repetitions of and means that is optional.  A BNF version of the production rules for a SageMath variable, , is    The language of simple arithmetic expressions An arithmetic expression can be defined in BNF. For simplicity, we will consider only expressions obtained using addition and multiplication of integers. The terminal symbols are ( , ) , + , * , - , and the digits 0 through 9. The nonterminal symbols are (for expression), (term), (factor), and (number). The starting symbol is . Production rules are .  One particularly simple type of phrase structure grammar is the regular grammar.   Regular Grammar  Regular Grammar  A regular (right-hand form) grammar is a grammar whose production rules are all of the form and , where and are nonterminal and is terminal. A left-hand form grammar allows only and . A language that has a regular phrase structure language is called a regular language.   The set of Sage variable names is a regular language since the grammar by which we defined the set is a regular grammar.  The language of all strings for which all 0's precede all 1's ( ) is regular; however, the grammar by which we defined this set is not regular. Can you define these strings with a regular grammar?  The language of arithmetic expressions is not regular.    Exercises   If a computer is being designed to operate with a character set of 350 symbols, how many bits must be reserved for each character? Assume each character will use the same number of bits.  Do the same for 3,500 symbols.      For a character set of 350 symbols, the number of bits needed for each character is the smallest such that is greater than or equal to 350. Since , 9 bits are needed,   ; therefore, 12 bits are needed.    It was pointed out in the text that the null string and the null set are different. The former is a string and the latter is a set, two different kinds of objects. Discuss how the two are similar.   What sets of strings are defined by the following grammar?  Terminal symbols: , 0 and 1  Nonterminal symbols: and  Starting symbol:   Production rules:    This grammar defines the set of all strings over for which each string is a palindrome (same string if read forward or backward).  What sets of strings are defined by the following grammar?  Terminal symbols: , , , and  Nonterminal symbols:  Starting symbol:  Production rules:     Define the following languages over with phrase structure grammars. Which of these languages are regular?  The strings with an odd number of characters.  The strings of length 4 or less.  The palindromes, strings that are the same backwards as forwards.      Terminal symbols: The null string, 0, and 1. Nonterminal symbols: , . Starting symbol: . Production rules: , , , , , , This is a regular grammar.  Terminal symbols: The null string, 0, and 1. Nonterminal symbols: , , , Starting symbol: Production rules: , , , , , , , , , , , This is a regular grammar.  See Exercise 3. This language is not regular.    Define the following languages over with phrase structure grammars. Which of these languages are regular?  The strings with more 0's than 1's.  The strings with an even number of 1's.  The strings for which all 0's precede all 1's.     Prove that if a language over is recursive, then its complement is also recursive.  If is in and is recursive, we can answer the question Is s in ? by negating the answer to Is in ?   Use BNF to define the grammars in Exercises 3 and 4.    Prove that if is a countable sequence of countable sets, the union of these sets, is countable.  Using the fact that the countable union of countable sets is countable, prove that if is countable, then is countable.    List the elements of each set in a sequence , , . Then draw arrows as shown below and list the elements of the union in order established by this pattern: , , , , , , , , , , ,  Each of the sets , , , are countable and is the union of these sets; hence is countable.

  "title": "Automata, Finite-State Machines",
  "body": " Automata, Finite-State Machines  Automata  Finite-State Machines  In this section, we will introduce the concept of an abstract machine. The machines we will examine will (in theory) be capable of performing many of the tasks associated with digital computers. One such task is solving the recognition problem for a language. We will concentrate on one class of machines, finite-state machines (finite automata). And we will see that they are precisely the machines that are capable of recognizing strings in a regular grammar.  Given an alphabet , we will imagine a string in to be encoded on a tape that we will call an input tape. When we refer to a tape, we might imagine a strip of material that is divided into segments, each of which can contain either a letter or a blank.  The typical abstract machine includes an input device, the read head, which is capable of reading the symbol from the segment of the input tape that is currently in the read head. Some more advanced machines have a read\/write head that can also write symbols onto the tape. The movement of the input tape after reading a symbol depends on the machine. With a finite-state machine, the next segment of the input tape is always moved into the read head after a symbol has been read. Most machines (including finite-state machines) also have a separate output tape that is written on with a write head. The output symbols come from an output alphabet, , that may or may not be equal to the input alphabet. The most significant component of an abstract machine is its memory structure. This structure can range from a finite number of bits of memory (as in a finite-state machine) to an infinite amount of memory that can be stored in the form of a tape that can be read from and written on (as in a Turing machine).  Finite-State Machine  Finite-State Machine  A finite-state machine with states , input alphabet , output alphabet , and output function and next-state function  A finite-state machine is defined by a quintet where   is the state set, a finite set that corresponds to the set of memory configurations that the machine can have at any time.   is the input alphabet.   is the output alphabet.   is the output function, which specifies which output symbol is written onto the output tape when the machine is in state and the input symbol is read.   is the next-state (or transition) function, which specifies which state the machine should enter when it is in state and it reads the symbol .    Vending Machine as a Finite-State Machine Many mechanical devices, such as simple vending machines, can be thought of as finite-state machines. For simplicity, assume that a vending machine dispenses packets of gum, spearmint (S), peppermint (P), and bubble (B), for cents each. We can define the input alphabet to be and the state set to be , where the deposit of a quarter unlocks the release mechanism of the machine and allows you to select a flavor of gum. We will leave it to the reader to imagine what the output alphabet, output function, and next-state function would be. You are also invited to let your imagination run wild and include such features as a coin-return lever and change maker.  A Parity Checking Machine The following machine is called a parity checker. It recognizes whether or not a string in contains an even number of 1s. The memory structure of this machine reflects the fact that in order to check the parity of a string, we need only keep track of whether an odd or even number of 1's has been detected.  The input alphabet is and the output alphabet is also . The state set is . The following table defines the output and next-state functions.   Note how the value of the most recent output at any time is an indication of the current state of the machine. Therefore, if we start in the even state and read any finite input tape, the last output corresponds to the final state of the parity checker and tells us the parity of the string on the input tape. For example, if the string 11001010 is read from left to right, the output tape, also from left to right, will be 10001100. Since the last character is a 0, we know that the input string has even parity.   An alternate method for defining a finite-state machine is with a transition diagram. A transition diagram is a directed graph that contains a node for each state and edges that indicate the transition and output functions. An edge that is labeled indicates that in state the input results in an output of and the next state is . That is, and . The transition diagram for the parity checker appears in . In later examples, we will see that if there are different inputs, and , while in the same state resulting in the same transitions and outputs, we label a single edge instead of drawing two edges with labels and .   Transition Diagram for a Parity Checker   Transition Diagram for a Parity Checker    One of the most significant features of a finite-state machine is that it retains no information about its past states that can be accessed by the machine itself. For example, after we input a tape encoded with the symbols 01101010 into the parity checker, the current state will be even, but we have no indication within the machine whether or not it has always been in even state. Note how the output tape is not considered part of the machine's memory. In this case, the output tape does contain a history of the parity checker's past states. We assume that the finite-state machine has no way of recovering the output sequence for later use.  A Baseball Machine Consider the following simplified version of the game of baseball. To be precise, this machine describes one half-inning of a simplified baseball game. Suppose that in addition to home plate, there is only one base instead of the usual three bases. Also, assume that there are only two outs per inning instead of the usual three. Our input alphabet will consist of the types of hits that the batter could have: out (O), double play (DP), single (S), and home run (HR). The input DP is meant to represent a batted ball that would result in a double play (two outs), if possible. The input DP can then occur at any time. The output alphabet is the numbers 0, 1, and 2 for the number of runs that can be scored as a result of any input. The state set contains the current situation in the inning, the number of outs, and whether a base runner is currently on the base. The list of possible states is then 00 (for 0 outs and 0 runners), 01, 10, 11, and end (when the half-inning is over). The transition diagram for this machine appears in   Transition Diagram for a simplified game of baseball   Transition Diagram for a simplified game of baseball    Let's concentrate on one state. If the current state is 01, 0 outs and 1 runner on base, each input results in a different combination of output and next-state. If the batter hits the ball poorly (a double play) the output is zero runs and the inning is over (the limit of two outs has been made). A simple out also results in an output of 0 runs and the next state is 11, one out and one runner on base. If the batter hits a single, one run scores (output = 1) while the state remains 01. If a home run is hit, two runs are scored (output = 2) and the next state is 00. If we had allowed three outs per inning, this graph would only be marginally more complicated. The usual game with three bases would be quite a bit more complicated, however.   Recognition in Regular Languages  As we mentioned at the outset of this section, finite-state machines can recognize strings in a regular language. Consider the language over that contains the strings of positive length in which each is followed by and each is followed by . One such string is . This language is regular. A grammar for the language would be nonterminal symbols with starting symbol and production rules , , , , , . A finite-state machine ( ) that recognizes this language can be constructed with one state for each nonterminal symbol and an additional state (Reject) that is entered if any invalid production takes place. At the end of an input tape that encodes a string in , we will know when the string belongs to based on the final output. If the final output is 1, the string belongs to and if it is 0, the string does not belong to . In addition, recognition can be accomplished by examining the final state of the machine. The input string belongs to the language if and only if the final state is .         The construction of this machine is quite easy: note how each production rule translates into an edge between states other than Reject. For example, indicates that in State , an input of places the machine into State . Not all sets of production rules can be as easily translated to a finite-state machine. Another set of production rules for is , , , , and . Techniques for constructing finite-state machines from production rules is not our objective here. Hence we will only expect you to experiment with production rules until appropriate ones are found.   A Binary Adder A finite-state machine can be designed to add positive integers of any size. Given two integers in binary form, and , the machine take as its input sequence the corresponding bits of and reading from right to left with a parity bit added  Notice the special input 111 at the end. All possible inputs except the last one must even parity (contain an even number of ones). The output sequence is the sum of and , starting with the units digit, and comes from the set .

Gray Code Decoder   Gray Code Decoder    Given a string , we may ask where appears in .

For example, if the string 11001010 is read from left to right, the output tape, also from left to right, will be 10001100. Since the last character is a 0, we know that the input string has even parity.  "

Suppose that in addition to home plate, there is only one base instead of the usual three bases. Also, assume that there are only two outs per inning instead of the usual three. Our input alphabet will consist of the types of hits that the batter could have: out (O), double play (DP), single (S), and home run (HR). The input DP is meant to represent a batted ball that would result in a double play (two outs), if possible. The input DP can then occur at any time. The output alphabet is the numbers 0, 1, and 2 for the number of runs that can be scored as a result of any input. The state set contains the current situation in the inning, the number of outs, and whether a base runner is currently on the base. The list of possible states is then 00 (for 0 outs and 0 runners), 01, 10, 11, and end (when the half-inning is over). The transition diagram for this machine appears in   Transition Diagram for a simplified game of baseball   Transition Diagram for a simplified game of baseball    Let's concentrate on one state. If the current state is 01, 0 outs and 1 runner on base, each input results in a different combination of output and next-state. If the batter hits the ball poorly (a double play) the output is zero runs and the inning is over (the limit of two outs has been made). A simple out also results in an output of 0 runs and the next state is 11, one out and one runner on base. If the batter hits a single, one run scores (output = 1) while the state remains 01. If a home run is hit, two runs are scored (output = 2) and the next state is 00. If we had allowed three outs per inning, this graph would only be marginally more complicated. The usual game with three bases would be quite a bit more complicated, however.  "

A grammar for the language would be nonterminal symbols with starting symbol and production rules , , , , , . A finite-state machine ( ) that recognizes this language can be constructed with one state for each nonterminal symbol and an additional state (Reject) that is entered if any invalid production takes place.

  "title": "The Monoid of a Finite-State Machine",
  "body": " The Monoid of a Finite-State Machine  Monoid of a Finite-State Machine  In this section, we will see how every finite-state machine has a monoid associated with it. For any finite-state machine, the elements of its associated monoid correspond to certain input sequences. Because only a finite number of combinations of states and inputs is possible for a finite-state machine there is only a finite number of input sequences that summarize the machine. This idea is illustrated best with a few examples.  Consider the parity checker. The following table summarizes the effect on the parity checker of strings in and . The row labeled Even contains the final state and final output as a result of each input string in and when the machine starts in the even state. Similarly, the row labeled Odd contains the same information for input sequences when the machine starts in the odd state.  Note how, as indicated in the last row, the strings in have the same effect as certain strings in . For this reason, we can summarize the machine in terms of how it is affected by strings of length 1. The actual monoid that we will now describe consists of a set of functions, and the operation on the functions will be based on the concatenation operation.  Let be the final effect (state and output) on the parity checker of the input 0. Similarly, is defined as the final effect on the parity checker of the input 1. More precisely, while  In general, we define the operation on a set of such functions as follows: if , are input sequences and and , are functions as above, then , that is, the result of the function that summarizes the effect on the machine by the concatenation of with . Since, for example, 01 has the same effect on the parity checker as 1, . We don't stop our calculation at because we want to use the shortest string of inputs to describe the final result. A complete table for the monoid of the parity checker is  What is the identity of this monoid? The monoid of the parity checker is isomorphic to the monoid .  This operation may remind you of the composition operation on functions, but there are two principal differences. The domain of is not the codomain of and the functions are read from left to right unlike in composition, where they are normally read from right to left.  You may have noticed that the output of the parity checker echoes the state of the machine and that we could have looked only at the effect on the machine as the final state. The following example has the same property, hence we will only consider the final state.  The transition diagram for the machine that recognizes strings in that have no consecutive 1's appears in . Note how it is similar to the graph in . Only a reject state has been added, for the case when an input of 1 occurs while in State . We construct a similar table to the one in the previous example to study the effect of certain strings on this machine. This time, we must include strings of length 3 before we recognize that no new effects can be found.   No Consecutive Ones Monoid   No Consecutive Ones Monoid      The following table summarizes how combinations of the strings affect this machine.   All the results in this table can be obtained using the previous table. For example,   Note that none of the elements that we have listed in this table serves as the identity for our operation. This problem can always be remedied by including the function that corresponds to the input of the null string, . Since the null string is the identity for concatenation of strings, for all input strings .  The Unit-time Delay Machine A finite-state machine called the unit-time delay machine does not echo its current state, but prints its previous state. For this reason, when we find the monoid of the unit-time delay machine, we must consider both state and output. The transition diagram of this machine appears in .    Unit time delay graph       Again, since no new outcomes were obtained from strings of length 3, only strings of length 2 or less contribute to the monoid of the machine. The table for the strings of positive length shows that we must add to obtain a monoid.   .   Exercises  For each of the transition diagrams in , write out tables for their associated monoids. Identify the identity in terms of a string of positive length, if possible.   Exercise 1   Exercise 1 of section 14.4    Where the output echoes the current state, the output can be ignored.      We can see that , , etc. Therefore, we have the following monoid:   Notice that is the identity of this monoid.       We have the following monoid:   Notice that is the identity of this monoid.   What common monoids are isomorphic to the monoids obtained in the previous exercise?   Can two finite-state machines with nonisomorphic transition diagrams have isomorphic monoids? Yes, just consider the unit time delay machine of . Its monoid is described by the table at the end of Section 14.4 where the row and column are omitted. Next consider the machine in . The monoid of this machine is:   Hence both of these machines have the same monoid, however, their transition diagrams are nonisomorphic since the first has two vertices and the second has seven.

That is, , in which case is called a generator of . The reader should note that additive notation is used for .  A Finite Cyclic Group , where is addition modulo 12, is a cyclic group. To verify this statement, all we need to do is demonstrate that some element of is a generator. One such element is 5; that is, . One more obvious generator is 1. In fact, 1 is a generator of every . The reader is asked to prove that if an element is a generator, then its inverse is also a generator. Thus, and are the other generators of . The remaining eight elements of the group are not generators.   Examples of string art    Examples of string art    (a) is an example of string art that illustrates how 5 generates . Twelve tacks are placed evenly around a circle and numbered 0 through 11. A string is tied to tack 0, and is then looped around every fifth tack. As a result, the numbers of the tacks that are reached are exactly the ordered multiples of 5 modulo 12: 5, 10, 3, ... , 7, 0. Note that if every seventh tack were used, the same artwork would be produced. If every third tack were connected, as in (b), the resulting loop would only use four tacks; thus 3 does not generate .   The Group of Integers is Cyclic The additive group of integers, , is cyclic: This observation does not mean that every integer is the product of an integer times 1. It means that   Cyclic Implies Abelian  If is cyclic, then it is abelian.  Let be any generator of and let . By the definition of the generator of a group, there exist integers and such that and . Thus, using ,   One of the first steps in proving a property of cyclic groups is to use the fact that there exists a generator. Then every element of the group can be expressed as some multiple of the generator. Take special note of how this is used in theorems of this section.  Up to now we have used only additive notation to discuss cyclic groups. actually justifies this practice since it is customary to use additive notation when discussing abelian groups. Of course, some concrete groups for which we employ multiplicative notation are cyclic. If one of its elements, , is a generator,   A Cyclic Multiplicative Group The group of positive integers modulo 11 with modulo 11 multiplication, , is cyclic. One of its generators is 6: , , , , , and , the identity of the group.  A Non-cyclic Group The real numbers with addition, is a noncyclic group. The proof of this statement requires a bit more generality since we are saying that for all , is a proper subset of . If is nonzero, the multiples of are distributed over the real line, as in . It is clear then that there are many real numbers, like , that are not in .   Elements of    Elements of the cylic subgroup generated by a real number     The next two proofs make use of the .  The following theorem shows that a cyclic group can never be very complicated.  Possible Cyclic Group Structures  If is a cyclic group, then is either finite or countably infinite. If is finite and , it is isomorphic to . If is infinite, it is isomorphic to .  Case 1: . If is a generator of and , define by for all .  Since is finite, we can use the fact that the elements of are the first nonnegative multiples of . From this observation, we see that is a surjection. A surjection between finite sets of the same cardinality must be a bijection. Finally, if , Therefore is an isomorphism.  Case 2: . We will leave this case as an exercise.   Subgroups of Cyclic Groups  Every subgroup of a cyclic group is cyclic.  Let be cyclic with generator and let . If , has as a generator. We may now assume that and . Let be the least positive integer such that belongs to . This is the key step. It lets us get our hands on a generator of . We will now show that generates . Certainly, , but suppose that . Then there exists such that . Now, since is in , there exists such that . We now apply the division property and divide by . , where . We note that cannot be zero for otherwise we would have . Therefore, . This contradicts our choice of because .  All subgroups of The only proper subgroups of are and . They are both cyclic: , while . The generators of are 1, 3, 7, and 9.  All subgroups of With the exception of , all subgroups of are isomorphic to . If , then is the cyclic subgroup generated by the least positive element of . It is infinite and so by it is isomorphic to .  We now cite a useful theorem for computing the order of cyclic subgroups of a cyclic group:  The order of elements of a finite cyclic group Order of elements of a finite cyclic group If is a cyclic group of order and is a generator of , the order of is , where is the greatest common divisor of and .  The proof of this theorem is left to the reader.  Computation of an order in a cyclic group To compute the order of in , we first observe that 1 is a generator of and . The greatest common divisor of 18 and 30 is 6. Hence, the order of is 30\/6, or 5.  At this point, we will introduce the idea of a fast adder, a relatively modern application (Winograd, 1965) of an ancient theorem, Sun Tzu's Theorem. We will present only an overview of the theory and rely primarily on examples.  Out of necessity, integer addition with a computer is addition modulo , for some larger number. Consider the case where is small, like 64. Then addition involves the addition of six-digit binary numbers. Consider the process of adding 31 and 1. Assume the computer's adder takes as input two bit strings and and outputs , the sum of and . Then, if and , will be (0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1), or 32. The output cannot be determined until all other outputs have been determined. If addition is done with a finite-state machine, as in , the time required to get will be six time units, where one time unit is the time it takes to get one output from the machine. In general, the time required to obtain will be proportional to the number of bits. Theoretically, this time can be decreased, but the explanation would require a long digression and our relative results would not change that much. We will use the rule that the number of time units needed to perform addition modulo is proportional to .  Now we will introduce a hypothetical problem that we will use to illustrate the idea of a fast adder. Suppose that we had to add 1,000 numbers modulo . By the rule above, since , each addition would take 15 time units. If the sum is initialized to zero, 1,000 additions would be needed; thus, 15,000 time units would be needed to do the additions. We can improve this time dramatically by applying Sun Tzu's Theorem. Recall that is the remainder upon division of by .  Sun Tzu's Theorem  Sun Tzu's Theorem  Chinese Remainder Theorem  STT Sun Tzu's Theorem  Let , , , be integers that have no common factor greater than one between any pair of them; i. e., they are relatively prime. Let . Define by where for , and . Then is an isomorphism from into .  Sun Tzu's Theorem can be stated in several different forms, and its proof can be found in many abstract algebra texts. Older texts most likely will refer to the theorem as the Chinese Remainder Theorem.  As we saw in Chapter 11, is isomorphic to . This is the smallest case to which Sun Tzu's Theorem can be applied. An isomorphism between and is  Let's consider a somewhat larger case. We start by selecting a modulus that can be factored into a product of relatively prime integers: . In this case the factors are , , and . They need not be powers of primes, but it is easy to break the factors into this form to assure relatively prime numbers. To add in , we need time units. Let . Sun Tzu's Theorem gives us an isomorphism between and . The basic idea behind the fast adder, illustrated in , is to make use of this isomorphism. The notation x += a is interpreted as the instruction to add the value of a to the variable x .   Fast Adder Scheme   Fast Adder Scheme    Assume we have several integers to be added. Here, we assume . We compute the sum s to compare our result with this true sum.   Although our sum is an integer calculation, we will put our calculation in the context of the integers modulo 21600. The isomophism from into is defined in Sage as theta . In addition we demonstrate that the operations in these groups are preserved by theta .   We initialize the sums in each factor of the range of theta to zero and decompose each summand into a triple .   Addition in can be done in parallel so that each new subtotal in the form of the triple takes only as long to compute as it takes to add in the largest modulus, time units, if calculations are done in parallel. By the time rule that we have established, the addition of 20 numbers can be done in time units, as opposed to time units if we do the calculations in . However the result is a triple in . The function that performs the inverse of theta is built into most mathematics programs, including Sage. In Sage the function is crt , short for Chinese Remainder Theorem, the other common name of Sun Tzu's Theorem. We use this function to compute the inverse of our triple, which is an element of . The result isn't the true sum because the modulus 21600 is not large enough. However, we verify that our result is congruent to the true sum modulo 21600.   In order to get the true sum from our scheme, the modulus would need to be increased by moving from 21600 to, for example, . Mapping into the new group, will take slightly longer, as will the inversion process with crt , but adding the summands that are in the form of quadruples can be done with no additional time.  The computation of that is done by the Sage function crt can be accomplished in a variety of ways. All of them ultimately are simplified by the fact that is also an isomorphism. One approach is to use the isomorphism property to realize that the value of is . The arithmetic in this expression is in the domain of and is more time consuming, but it need only be done once. This is why the fast adder is only practical in situations where many additions must be performed to get a single sum.  The inverse images of the unit vectors can be computed ahead of time.   The result we computed earlier can be computed directly by in the larger modulus.   To further illustrate the potential of fast adders, consider increasing the modulus to . Each addition using the usual modulo addition with full adders would take 72 time units. By decomposing each summand into 15-tuples according to Sun Tzu's Theorem, the time is reduced to time units per addition.   Exercises  What generators besides 1 does have?

The numbers of these tacks correspond to .   String art cosets   String art cosets    What happens if you start at one of the unused tacks and again jump to every third tack? The two broken paths on show that identical squares are produced. The tacks are thus partitioned into very similar subsets. The subsets of that they correspond to are , , and . These subsets are called cosets. In particular, they are called cosets of the subgroup . We will see that under certain conditions, cosets of a subgroup can form a group of their own. Before pursuing this example any further we will examine the general situation.  Coset  Coset  the left and right cosets generated by  If is a group, and , the left coset of generated by is and the right coset of generated by is     itself is both a left and right coset since .

A Duality Principle A duality principle can be formulated concerning cosets because left and right cosets are defined in such similar ways. Any theorem about left and right cosets will yield a second theorem when left and right are exchanged for right and left.   If , then , and if , then .

In order to show that , one can follow essentially the same steps, which we will let the reader fill in.  In , you can start at either 1 or 7 and obtain the same path by taking jumps of three tacks in each step. Thus,  The set of left (or right) cosets of a subgroup partition a group in a special way:  Cosets Partition a Group Partition of a group by cosets  If is a group and , the set of left cosets of is a partition of . In addition, all of the left cosets of have the same cardinality. The same is true for right cosets.  That every element of belongs to a left coset is clear because for all .

We complete the proof by showing that each left coset has the same cardinality as . To do this, we simply observe that if , defined by is a bijection and hence .

For this reason we use to denote the set of left cosets of in  This follows from the partitioning of into equal sized sets, one of which is .  The set of integer multiples of four, , is a subgroup of . Four distinct cosets of partition the integers. They are , , , and , where, for example, . can also be written .  Distinguished Representatives Although we have seen that any representative can describe a coset, it is often convenient to select a distinguished representative from each coset. The advantage to doing this is that there is a unique name for each coset in terms of its distinguished representative. In numeric examples such as the one above, the distinguished representative is usually the smallest nonnegative representative. Remember, this is purely a convenience and there is absolutely nothing wrong in writing , , or in place of because .  Before completing the main thrust of this section, we will make note of a significant implication of . Since a finite group is divided into cosets of a common size by any subgroup, we can conclude:  Lagrange's Theorem  Lagrange's Theorem  The order of a subgroup of a finite group must divide the order of the group.   One immediate implication of Lagrange's Theorem is that if is prime, has no proper subgroups.  We will now describe the operation on cosets which will, under certain circumstances, result in a group. For most of this section, we will assume that is an abelian group. This is one sufficient (but not necessary) condition that guarantees that the set of left cosets will form a group.  Operation on Cosets  Cosets Operation on  Let and be left cosets of , a subgroup of with representatives and , respectively. Then The operation is called the operation induced on left cosets by .  In , later in this section, we will prove that if is an abelian group, is indeed an operation. In practice, if the group is an additive group, the symbol is replaced by , as in the following example.  Computing with cosets of  Consider the cosets described in . For brevity, we rename , , , and with the symbols , , , and . Let's do a typical calculation, . We will see that the result is always going to be , no matter what representatives we select. For example, , , and . Our choice of the representatives and were completely arbitrary.  In general, can be computed in many ways, and so it is necessary to show that the choice of representatives does not affect the result. When the result we get for is always independent of our choice of representatives, we say that is well defined. Addition of cosets is a well-defined operation on the left cosets of 4 and is summarized in the following table. Do you notice anything familiar?   Cosets of the integers in the group of Real numbers  Consider the group of real numbers, , and its subgroup of integers, . Every element of has the same cardinality as . Let . if can be written for some . Hence and belong to the same coset if they differ by an integer. (See for a generalization of this fact.)  Now consider the coset . Real numbers that differ by an integer from 0.25 are and . If any real number is selected, there exists a representative of its coset that is greater than or equal to 0 and less than 1. We will call that representative the distinguished representative of the coset. For example, 43.125 belongs to the coset represented by 0.125; has 0.618 as its distinguished representative. The operation on is commonly called addition modulo 1. A few typical calculations in are .  Cosets in a Direct Product  Consider , where . Since is of order 8, each element of is a coset containing two ordered pairs. We will leave it to the reader to verify that the four distinct cosets are , , and . The reader can also verify that is isomorphic to , since is cyclic. An educated guess should give you a generator.   Consider the group . Let be , the cyclic subgroup of generate by (1,0,1,0). Since the order of is 2 and , has elements. A typical coset is Note that since , , the identity for the operation on . The orders of non-identity elements of this factor group are all 2, and it can be shown that the factor group is isomorphic to .   Coset operation is well-defined (Abelian Case)  If is an abelian group, and , the operation induced on cosets of by the operation of is well defined. Suppose that , , and , . are two choices for representatives of cosets and . That is to say that , . We will show that and are representatives of the same coset. 1 implies that and , thus we have and . Then there exists such that and and so by various group properties and the assumption that is abelian, which lets us reverse the order in which and appear in the chain of equalities. This last expression for implies that since because is a subgroup of . Thus, we get the same coset for both pairs of representatives.   Let be a group and . If the operation induced on left cosets of by the operation of is well defined, then the set of left cosets forms a group under that operation.  Let , and be the left cosets with representatives , , and , respectively. The values of and are determined by and , respectively. By the associativity of in , these two group elements are equal and so the two coset expressions must be equal. Therefore, the induced operation is associative. As for the identity and inverse properties, there is no surprise. The identity coset is , or , the coset that contains 's identity. If is a coset with representative ; that is, if , then is . .  Factor Group  Factor Group  The factor group G mod H. Let be a group and . If the set of left cosets of forms a group, then that group is called the factor group of modulo . It is denoted .  If is abelian, then every subgroup of yields a factor group. We will delay further consideration of the non-abelian case to Section 15.4.  On Notation It is customary to use the same symbol for the operation of as for the operation on . The reason we used distinct symbols in this section was to make the distinction clear between the two operations.   Exercises  Consider and the subsets of , and . Why is the operation induced on these subsets by modulo 10 addition not well defined?  An example of a valid correct answer: Call the subsets and respectively. If we choose and we get . On the other hand, if we choose and , we get . Therefore, the induced operation is not well defined on .  Can you think of a group , with a subgroup such that and ? Is your answer unique?

  "body": " Permutation Groups  Permutation Groups  The Symmetric Groups  At the risk of boggling the reader's mind, we will now examine groups whose elements are functions. Recall that a permutation on a set is a bijection from into . Suppose that . There are different permutations on . We will call the set of all 6 permutations . They are listed in the following table. The matrix form for describing a function on a finite set is to list the domain across the top row and the image of each element directly below it. For example .   Elements of               The operation that will give a group structure is function composition. Consider the product  : .  The images of 1, 2, and 3 under and are identical. Thus, by the definition of equality for functions, we can say . The complete table for the operation of function composition is given in .   Operation Table for      We don't even need the table to verify that we have a group. Based on the following observations, the set of all permutations on any finite set will be a group.   Function composition is always associative.  The identity for the group is . If is any one of the permutations on and , Therefore .  A permutation, by definition, is a bijection. In Chapter 7 we proved that this implies that it must have an inverse and the inverse itself is a bijection and hence a permutation. Hence all elements of have an inverse in . If a permutation is displayed in matrix form, its inverse can be obtained by exchanging the two rows and rearranging the columns so that the top row is in order. The first step is actually sufficient to obtain the inverse, but the sorting of the top row makes it easier to recognize the inverse.  For example, let's consider a typical permutation on , . .    From , we can see that is non-abelian. Remember, non-abelian is the negation of abelian. The existence of two elements that don't commute is sufficient to make a group non-abelian. In this group, and is one such pair: while , so . Caution: Don't take this to mean that every pair of elements has to have this property. There are several pairs of elements in that do commute. In fact, the identity, , must commute with everything. Also every element must commute with its inverse.  Symmetric Group Symmetric Group  The group of permutations of the set  The group of permutations on a set with elements  Let be a nonempty set. The set of all permutations on with the operation of function composition is called the symmetric group on , denoted .  The cardinality of a finite set is more significant than the elements, and we will denote by the symmetric group on any set of cardinality , .  The significance of Our opening example, , is the smallest non-abelian group. For that reason, all of its proper subgroups are abelian: in fact, they are all cyclic. shows the Hasse diagram for the subgroups of .   Lattice diagram of subgroups of    Lattice diagram of subgroups of     Smallest Symmetric Groups The only abelian symmetric groups are and , with 1 and 2 elements, respectively. The elements of are and . is isomorphic to .   For , and for , is non-abelian. The first part of the theorem follows from the extended rule of products (see Chapter 2). We leave the details of proof of the second part to the reader after the following hint. Consider in where , , , and for . Therefore the cycle representation of is . Now define in a similar manner so that when you compare and you get different results.   Cycle Notation Cycle Notation  A second way of describing a permutation is by means of cycles, which we will introduce first with an example. Consider defined using the now-familiar matrix notation: Consider the images of 1 when is applied repeatedly. The images , , are . In (a), this situation is represented by a graph with vertices 1, 8, 3, and 7 and shows that the values that you get by repeatedly applying cycle through those values. This is why we refer to this part of as a cycle of length 4. Of course starting at 8, 3, or 7 also produces the same cycle with only the starting value changing.   Representations of a cycle of length 4   Representations of a cycle of length 4    (a) illustrates how the cycle can be represented in a visual manner, but it is a bit awkward to write. Part (b) of the figure presents a more universally recognized way to write a cycle. In (b), a cycle is represented by a list where the image of any number in the list is its successor. In addition, the last number in the list has as its image the first number.  The other elements of the domain of are never reached if you start in the cycle , and so looking at the images of these other numbers will produce numbers that are disjoint from the set . The other disjoint cycles of are (2), (4, 6), and (5). We can express as a product of disjoint cycles: or , where the absence of 2 and 5 implies that and .  Disjoint Cycles Disjoint Cycles We say that two cycles are disjoint if no number appears in both cycles, as is the case in our expressions for above. Disjoint cycles can be written in any order. Thus, we could also say that .  Composition of Permutations Permutations Composition We will now consider the composition of permutations written in cyclic form by an example. Suppose that and are elements of . To calculate , we start with simple concatenation: Although this is a valid expression for , our goal is to express the composition as a product of disjoint cycles as and were individually written. We will start by determining the cycle that contains 1. When combining any number of cycles, they are always read from right to left, as with all functions. The first cycle in does not contain 1; thus we move on to the second. The image of 1 under that cycle is 5. Now we move on to the next cycle, looking for 5, which doesn't appear. The fourth cycle does not contain a 5 either; so .  At this point, we would have written on paper. We repeat the steps to determine . This time the second cycle of moves 5 to 6 and then the third cycle moves 6 to 4. Therefore, . We continue until the cycle (1, 5, 4, 3) is completed by determining that . The process is then repeated starting with any number that does not appear in the cycle(s) that have already been completed.  The final result for our example is . Since and , and we need not include the one-cycle (2) in the final result, although it can be included.    Some Compositions      .  Notice that cyclic notation does not indicate the set which is being permuted. The examples above could be in , where the image of 5 is 5. This ambiguity is usually overcome by making the context clear at the start of a discussion.   Transposition Transposition  A transposition is a cycle of length 2.  About transpositions and are transpositions in . However, and are not transpositions; thus, the set of transpositions is not closed under composition. Since and are both equal to the identity permutation, and are their own inverses. In fact, every transposition is its own inverse.  Decomposition into Cycles  Every cycle of length greater than 2 can be expressed as a product of transpositions.  We need only indicate how the product of transpositions can be obtained. It is easy to verify that a cycle of length , , is equal to the following product of transpositions:    Of course, a product of cycles can be written as a product of transpositions just as easily by applying the rule above to each cycle. For example, Unlike the situation with disjoint cycles, we are not free to change the order of these transpositions.   Parity of Permutations and the Alternating Group  A decomposition of permutations into transpositions makes it possible to classify them and identify an important family of groups.  The proofs of the following theorem appears in many abstract algebra texts.  Every permutation on a finite set can be expressed as the product of an even number of transpositions or an odd number of transpositions, but not both.  suggests that can be partitioned into its even and odd elements. For example, the even permutations of are , and . They form a subgroup, of .  In general:  The Alternating Group  Alternating Group  The Alternating Group  Let . The set of even permutations in is a proper subgroup of called the alternating group on , denoted .  We justify our statement that is a group:   Let . The alternating group is indeed a group and has order . In this proof, the symbols and stand for transpositions and , are even nonnegative integers. If , we can write the two permutations as products of even numbers of transpositions, and . Then Since is even, , and is closed with respect to function composition. With this, we have proven that is a subgroup of by .  To prove the final assertion, let be the set of odd permutations and let . Define by . Suppose that . Then and by the right cancellation law, . Hence, is an injection. Next we show that is also a surjection. If , is the image of an element of . Specifically, is the image of . Since is a bijection, .  The Sliding Tile Puzzle  Consider the sliding-tile puzzles pictured in . Each numbered square is a tile and the dark square is a gap. Any tile that is adjacent to the gap can slide into the gap. In most versions of this puzzle, the tiles are locked into a frame so that they can be moved only in the manner described above. The object of the puzzle is to arrange the tiles as they appear in Configuration (a). Configurations (b) and (c) are typical starting points. We propose to show why the puzzle can be solved starting with (b), but not with (c).   Configurations of the sliding tile puzzle   Configurations of the sliding tile puzzle    We will associate a change in the configuration of the puzzle with an element of . Imagine that a tile numbered 16 fills in the gap. For any configuration of the puzzle, the identity , is the function that leave the configurate as is. In general, if , and , is the position to which the tile in position is moved by that appears in the position of in configuration (a). If we call the functions that, starting with configuration (a), result in configurations (b) and (c) by the names and , respectively, and   How can we interpret the movement of one tile as a permutation? Consider what happens when the 12 tile of slides into the gap. The result is a configuration that we would interpret as , a single transposition. Now if we slide the 8 tile into the 12 position, the result is or . Hence, by exchanging the tiles 8 and 16, we have implemented the function .   The configuration    The configuration    Every time you slide a tile into the gap, the new permutation is a transposition composed with the old permutation. Now observe that to start with initial configuration and terminate after a finite number of moves with the gap in its original position, you must make an even number of moves. Thus, configuration corresponding any permutation that leaves 16 fixed cannot be solved if the permutation is odd. Note that is an odd permutation; thus, Puzzle (c) can't be solved. The proof that all even permutations, such as , can be solved is left to the interested reader to pursue.   Dihedral Groups  Dihedral Group  Realizations of Groups  By now we've seen several instances where a group can appear through an isomorphic copy of itself in various settings. The simplest such example is the cyclic group of order 2. When this group is mentioned, we might naturally think of the group , but the groups and are isomorphic to it. None of these groups are necessarily more natural or important than the others. Which one you use depends on the situation you are in and all are referred to as realizations of the cyclic group of order 2. The next family of groups we will study, the dihedral groups, has two natural realizations, first as permutations and second as geometric symmetries.  The family of dihedral groups is indexed by the positive integers greater than or equal to 3. For , will have elements. We first describe the elements and the operation on them using geometry.  We can describe in terms of symmetries of a regular -gon ( : equilateral triangle, : square, : regular pentagon, ). Here we will only concentrate on the case of . If a square is fixed in space, there are several motions of the square that will, at the end of the motion, not change the apparent position of the square. The actual changes in position can be seen if the corners of the square are labeled. In , the initial labeling scheme is shown, along with the four axes of symmetry of the square.   Axes of symmetry of the square   Axes of symmetry of the square    It might be worthwhile making a square like this with a sheet of paper. Be careful to label the back so that the numbers match the front. Two motions of the square will be considered equivalent if the square is in the same position after performing either motion. There are eight distinct motions. The first four are , , , and clockwise rotations of the square, and the other four are the flips along the axes , , , and . We will call the rotations , , and , respectively, and the flips , , , and , respectively. illustrates and . For future reference, we also include the permutations to which they correspond.   Two elements of    Two elements of    What is the operation on this set of symmetries? We will call the operation followed by and use the symbol to represent it. The operation will be to combine motions, applying motions from right to left, as with functions. We will illustrate how is computed by finding . Starting with the initial configuration, if you perform the motion, and then immediately perform on the result, we get the same configuration as if we just performed , which is to flip the square along the line . Therefore, . An important observation is that , meaning that this group is nonabelian. The reader is encouraged to verify this on their own.  We can also realize the dihedral groups as permutations. For any symmetric motion of the square we can associate with it a permutation. In the case of , the images of each of the numbers 1 through 4 are the positions on the square that each of the corners 1 through 4 are moved to. For example, since corner 4 moves to position 1 when you perform , the corresponding function will map 4 to 1. In addition, 1 gets mapped to 2, 2 to 3 and 3 to 4. Therefore, is the cycle . The flip transposes two pairs of corners and corresponds to . If we want to combine these two permutations, using the same names as with motions, we get Notice that this permutation corresponds with the flip .  Although isn't cyclic (since it isn't abelian), it can be generated from the two elements and :   It is quite easy to describe any of the dihedral groups in a similar fashion. Here is the formal definition  Dihedral Group  Dihedral Group Definition  The th dihedral group  Let be a positive integer greater than or equal to 3. If , an -cycle, and Then is the th dihedral group.    Caution You might notice that we use a script , , for the dihedral groups. Occasionally you might see an ordinary in other sources for the dihedral groups. Don't confuse it with the set of divisors of , which we denote by . Normally the context of the discussion should make the meaning of clear.  A Letter-facing Machine  An application of is in the design of a letter-facing machine. Imagine letters entering a conveyor belt to be postmarked. They are placed on the conveyor belt at random so that two sides are parallel to the belt. Suppose that a postmarker can recognize a stamp in the top right corner of the envelope, on the side facing up. In , a sequence of machines is shown that will recognize a stamp on any letter, no matter what position in which the letter starts. The letter stands for a postmarker. The letters and stand for rotating and flipping machines that perform the motions of and .   A letter facer   A letter facer    The arrows pointing up indicate that if a letter is postmarked, it is taken off the conveyor belt for delivery. If a letter reaches the end, it must not have a stamp. Letter-facing machines like this have been designed (see ). One economic consideration is that -machines tend to cost more than -machines. -machines also tend to damage more letters. Taking these facts into consideration, the reader is invited to design a better letter-facing machine. Assume that -machines cost and -machines cost . Be sure that all corners of incoming letters will be examined as they go down the conveyor belt.

  "body": " Normal Subgroups and Group Homomorphisms  Normal Subgroups  Homomorphism Group  Our goal in this section is to answer an open question from earlier in this chapter and introduce a related concept. The question is: When are left cosets of a subgroup a group under the induced operation? This question is open for non-abelian groups. Now that we have some examples to work with, we can try a few experiments.  Normal Subgroups  Normal Subgroups  Cosets of We have seen that is a subgroup of , and its left cosets are itself and . Whether is a group boils down to determining whether the induced operation is well defined. Consider the operation table for in .   Operation table for    Operation table for    We have shaded in all occurrences of the elements of in gray. We will call these elements the gray elements and the elements of the white ones.  Now consider the process of computing the coset product . The product is obtained by selecting one white element and one gray element. Note that white times gray is always gray. Thus, is well defined. Similarly, the other three possible products are well defined. The table for the factor group is   Clearly, is isomorphic to . Notice that and are also the right cosets of . This is significant.  Cosets of another subgroup of Now let's try the left cosets of in . There are three of them. Will we get a complicated version of ? The left cosets are , , and .  The reader might be expecting something to go wrong eventually, and here it is. To determine we can choose from four pairs of representatives: This time, we don't get the same coset for each pair of representatives. Therefore, the induced operation is not well defined and no factor group is produced.  This last example changes our course of action. If we had gotten a factor group from , we might have hoped to prove that every collection of left cosets forms a group. Now our question is: How can we determine whether we will get a factor group? Of course, this question is equivalent to: When is the induced operation well defined? There was only one step in the proof of , where we used the fact that was abelian. We repeat the equations here: since was abelian.  The last step was made possible by the fact that . As the proof continued, we used the fact that was in and so is for some in . All that we really needed in the abelian step was that . Then, since is closed under 's operation, is an element of . The consequence of this observation is that we define a certain kind of subgroup that guarantees that the inducted operation is well-defined.  Normal Subgroup  Normal Subgroup.  is a normal subgroup of  If is a group, , then is a normal subgroup of , denoted , if and only if every left coset of is a right coset of ; i. e.   If , then the operation induced on left cosets of by the operation of is well defined if and only if any one of the following conditions is true:  is a normal subgroup of .  If , , then there exists such that .  If , , then .    We leave the proof of this theorem to the reader.   Be careful, the following corollary is not an ...if and only if... statement.   If , then the operation induced on left cosets of by the operation of is well defined if either of the following two conditions is true.  is abelian.   .   A non-normal subgroup The right cosets of are , , and . These are not the same as the left cosets of . In addition, . Thus, is not normal.  The improper subgroups and of any group are normal subgroups. is isomorphic to . All other normal subgroups of a group, if they exist, are called proper normal subgroups .  By Condition b of , is a normal subgroup of and is isomorphic to .  Subgroups of , a group in its own right with 60 elements, has many proper subgroups, but none are normal. Although this could be done by brute force, the number of elements in the group would make the process tedious. A far more elegant way to approach the verification of this statement is to use the following fact about the cycle structure of permutations. If is a permutation with a certain cycle structure, , where the length of is , then for any , , which is the conjugate of by , will have a cycle structure with exactly the same cycle lengths. For example if we take and conjugate by ,   Notice that the condition for normality of a subgroup of is that the conjugate of any element of by an element of must be remain in .  To verify that has no proper normal subgroups, you can start by cataloging the different cycle structures that occur in and how many elements have those structures. Then consider what happens when you conjugate these different cycle structures with elements of . An outline of the process is in the exercises.  Let be the set of two by two invertible matrices of real numbers. That is, We saw in Chapter 11 that is a group with matrix multiplication.  This group has many subgroups, but consider just two: and . It is fairly simple to apply one of the conditions we have observed for normallity that a normal subgroup of , while is not normal in .   Homomorphisms  Think of the word isomorphism. Chances are, one of the first images that comes to mind is an equation something like An isomorphism must be a bijection, but the equation above is the algebraic property of an isomorphism. Here we will examine functions that satisfy equations of this type.  Homomorphism Homomorphism  Let and be groups. is a homomorphism if for all .  Many homomorphisms are useful since they point out similarities between the two groups (or, on the universal level, two algebraic systems) involved.  Decreasing modularity Define by . Therefore, , , , , , and . If . We could actually show that is a homomorphism by checking all different cases for the formula but we will use a line of reasoning that generalizes. We have already encountered Sun Tzu's Theorem, which implies that the function defined by . We need only observe that equating the first coordinates of both sides of the equation gives us precisely the homomorphism property.  Group Homomorphism Properties  If is a homomorphism, then:   .   for all .  If , then .     Let be any element of . Then . By cancellation, .  Again, let . . Hence, by the uniqueness of inverses, .  Let . Then there exists such that , . Recall that a compact necessary and sufficient condition for is that for all . Now we apply the same condition in : since , and so we can conclude that .     Since a homomorphism need not be a surjection and part (c) of is true for the case of , the range of , , is a subgroup of   If we define by , then is a homomorphism. The image of the subgroup is the single coset , the identity of the factor group. Homomorphisms of this type are called natural homomorphisms. The following theorems will verify that is a homomorphism and also show the connection between homomorphisms and normal subgroups. The reader can find more detail and proofs in most abstract algebra texts.   If , then the function defined by is a homomorphism. We leave the proof of this theorem to the reader.  Natural Homomorphism  Natural Homomorphism If , then the function defined by is called the natural homomorphism.  Based on , every normal subgroup gives us a homomorphism. Next, we see that the converse is true.  Kernel of a homomorphism Kernel  the kernel of homomorphism Let be a homomorphism, and let and be the identities of and , respectively. The kernel of is the set   Let be a homomorphism from into . The kernel of is a normal subgroup of . Let . We can see that is a subgroup of by letting and verify that by computing . To prove normality, we let be any element of and . We compute to verify that .   Based on this most recent theorem, every homomorphism gives us a normal subgroup.   Fundamental Theorem of Group Homomorphisms  Fundamental Theorem of Group Homomorphisms  Let be a homomorphism. Then is isomorphic to .    Define by . The three previous theorems imply the following:  defined by is a homomorphism.  .   is isomorphic to .    Let be the same group of two by two invertible real matrices as in . Define by . We will let the reader verify that is a homomorphism. The theorems above imply the following.   . This verifies our statement in . As in that example, let .   is isomorphic to .   defined, naturally, by is a homomorphism.    For the remainder of this section, we will be examining certain kinds of homomorphisms that will play a part in our major application to homomorphisms, coding theory.  Consider defined by . If ,   Since implies that and , the kernel of is . By previous theorems, is isomorphic to .   We can generalize the previous example as follows: If and is an matrix of 0's and 1's (elements of ), then defined by is a homomorphism. This is true because matrix multiplication is distributive over addition. The only new idea here is that computation is done in . If and , is true by basic matrix laws. Therefore, .    Exercises  Which of the following functions are homomorphisms? What are the kernels of those functions that are homomorphisms?   defined by .   where .   , where .   defined by .     Yes, the kernel is  No, since , but A follow-up might be to ask what happens if 5 is replaced with some other positive integer in this part.  Yes, the kernel is  No. A counterexample, among many, would be to consider the two transpositions and . Compare and .    Which of the following functions are homomorphisms?

Show that has one proper normal subgroup, but that is not normal.   is a normal subgroup of . To see you could use the table given in the solution of of Section 15.3 and verify that for all and . A more efficient approach is to prove the general theorem that if is a subgroup with exactly two distinct left cosets, than is normal. is not a normal subgroup of . and if we choose and then   Prove that the function in is a homomorphism.   Define the two functions and by , and Describe the function . Is it a homomorphism?   and so is the trivial homomorphism, but a homomorphism nevertheless.  Express in in matrix form.  Prove that if is an abelian group, then defines a homomorphism from into . Is ever an isomorphism?  Let . Hence, is a homomorphism. In order for to be an isomorphism, it must be the case that no element other than the identity is its own inverse.   Prove that if is a homomorphism, and , then . Is it also true that ?   Prove that if is a homomorphism, and , then . Proof: Recall that the inverse image of under is .  Closure: Let , then . Since is a subgroup of ,  Identity: By (a), .  Inverse: Let . Then and by (b), and so .  Following up on , prove that is a simple group; i. e., it has no proper normal subgroups.  Make a list of the different cycle structures that occur in and how many elements have those structures.  Within each set of permutations with different cycle structures, identify which subsets are closed with respect to the conjugation operation. With this you will have a partition of into conjugate classes where for each class, , if and only if such that .  Use the fact that a normal subgroup of needs to be a union of conjugate classes and verify that no such union exists.      "

  "title": "Coding Theory, Linear Codes",
  "body": " Coding Theory, Linear Codes  Coding Theory  Codes Linear  A Transmission Problem  In this section, we will introduce the basic ideas involved in coding theory and consider solutions of a coding problem by means of linear codes.  Imagine a situation in which information is being transmitted between two points. The information takes the form of high and low pulses (for example, radio waves or electric currents), which we will label 1 and 0, respectively. As these pulses are sent and received, they are grouped together in blocks of fixed length. The length determines how much information can be contained in one block. If the length is , there are different values that a block can have. If the information being sent takes the form of text, each block might be a character. In that case, the length of a block may be seven, so that block values can represent letters (both upper and lower case), digits, punctuation, and so on. During the transmission of data, noise can alter the signal so that what is received differs from what is sent. illustrates the problem that can be encountered if information is transmitted between two points.   A noisy transmission   A noisy transmission    Noise is a fact of life for anyone who tries to transmit information. Fortunately, in most situations we could expect a high percentage of the pulses that are sent to be received properly. However, when large numbers of pulses are transmitted, there are usually some errors due to noise. For the remainder of the discussion, we will make assumptions about the nature of the noise and the message that we want to send. Henceforth, we will refer to the pulses as bits.  We will assume that our information is being sent along a binary symmetric channel . By this, we mean that any single bit that is transmitted will be received improperly with a certain fixed probability, , independent of the bit value. The magnitude of is usually quite small. To illustrate the process, we will assume that , which, in the real world, would be considered somewhat large. Since , we can expect of all bits to be properly received.  In addition to assuming throughout, we will also suppose that our message consists of 3,000 bits of information. Two factors will be considered in evaluating a method of transmission. The first is the probability that the message is received with no errors. The second is the number of bits that will be transmitted in order to send the message. This quantity is called the rate of transmission: As you might expect, as we devise methods to improve the probability of success, the rate will decrease.  Suppose that we ignore the noise and transmit the message without any coding. The probability of success is . Therefore we only successfully receive the message in a totally correct form less than of the time. The rate of certainly doesn't offset this poor probability.  Our strategy for improving our chances of success will be to send an encoded message. The encoding will be done in such a way that small errors can be identified and corrected. This idea is illustrated in .   The Coding Process   The Coding Process    In all of our examples, the functions that will correspond to our encoding devices will involve multiplication of messages by matrices using mod 2 arithmetic. First we will introduce some geometric ideas to make the process more intuitive.   Introduction  Although we'll be using algebra to help improve communications, the basic solution can be imagined from a geometric point of view. For any positive integer , we define a distance function on the elements of the group . This distance is called the Hamming Distance .  Hamming Distance  Hamming Distance  Hamming distance between and  Given two elements of , and , the Hamming Distance, between them is the number of positions in which they differ.   For example, since these two elements of differ in just the last position; and . Notice that we can compute the distance between two bit strings by adding them coordinatewise in the Cartesian product and counting the number 's that appear in the sum. For example . The sum has two 's, so the distance between is . In addition, the location of the 's in the sum tell us where the two bit strings differ.  When we look at groups like from a point of view, we refer to these sets as metric spaces or simply spaces . In the case of , there are just points in the space and the maximum distance between the points is . More generally has points and the maximum distance between points in that space is . Looking at the group from this geometric point of view is essentially the same as the -cube we considered in discussing Hamiltonian graphs. In this section we will use -tuples such as interchangeably with strings of bits such as .  For any distance in a space, the ball of radius centered at a point , denoted , is the set of all points whose distance from is or less. For example, in the space ,  The ultimate goal of our encoding will be to take a set of possible messages, the message space , and distribute them in a larger space, the code space , in such a way that the encoded message, called a code word is at least a certain distance away from any other code word. The minimum distance between the code words will determine whether we can correct errors or just detect them. Now let's turn to some examples.   Error Detection  Suppose that each block of three bits is encoded with the function , where The fourth bit of is called the parity-check bit. When the encoded block is received, the four bits will probably all be correct (they are correct approximately of the time under our assumed parameters), but the added bit that is sent will make it possible to detect single bit errors in the block. Note that when is transmitted, the sum of its components is , since in .  If any single bit is garbled by noise, the sum of the received bits will be 1. A parity error occurs if the sum of the received bits is 1. Since more than one error is unlikely when is small, a high percentage of all errors can be detected.  At the receiving end, the decoding function acts on the four-bit block with the function , where Notice that the fourth bit of is an indicator of whether there is a parity error - 0 if no error, and 1 if an error. If no parity error occurs, the first three bits are recorded as part of the message. If a parity error occurs, we will assume that a retransmission of that block can be requested. This request can take the form of automatically having the parity-check bit of sent back to the source. If 1 is received, the previous block is retransmitted; if 0 is received, the next block is sent. This assumption of two-way communication is significant, but it is desirable to make this coding system useful. For our calculations, it is reasonable to expect that the probability of a transmission error in the opposite direction is also 0.001. Without going into the details, we will report that the probability of success in sending 3000 bits is approximately 0.990 and the rate is approximately . The rate includes the transmission of the parity-check bit to the source and is only approximate because the resent blocks will decrease the rate below somewhat.   The -cube with code words displayed as larger vertices   The -cube with code words displayed as larger vertices.    Let's consider the geometry of this code. If we examine the -cube in , the code words are the strings of four bits with an even number of ones. These vertices are the larger ones. Notice that the ball of radius 1 centered around any of the code words consists of that code word and the smaller vertices that are connected to the code word with an edge of the -cube. Since there are no other code-words in the ball, a single bit error produces a non-code word and so an error can be detected.   Error Correction  Next, we will consider coding functions that allow us to correct errors at the receiving end so that only one-way communication is needed. Before we begin, recall that every element of , , is its own inverse; that is, . Therefore, .  The Triple Repetition Code  Triple Repetition Code  Suppose we take each individual bit in our message and encode it by repeating it three times. In other words, if is a single bit, . The code words for this code are and . Let's look at the geometry behind this code. The message space has just two points, but the code space is , which has 8 points, the vertices of the -cube, which appears in .   The -cube with code words displayed as circular vertices   The -cube with code words displayed as circular vertices.    In the figure for this code, the code words are circular vertices. If we identify the balls of radius 1 centered around the two code words, you might notice that the two balls do not intersect. Each has a different vertex with triangular, square and pentagonal shapes. From a geometric point of view, this is why we can correct a single bit error. If any string of three bits in the code space is received it is in one of the two balls and the code word in that ball had to have been the one that was transmitted.  Regarding the actual correction process, the shapes have a meaning, as outlined in the following list.  Circle: No correction needed  Pentagon: Correct the first bit  Square: Correct the second bit  Triangle: Correct the third bit    Of course, once the correction is made, only the first bit is extracted from the code word since all bits will be equal. The simplicity of the final result masks an important property of all error correcting codes we consider. All of the possible points in the code space can be partitioned in such a way that each block in the partition corresponds with a specific correction that we can make to recover the correct code word.  If you have read about cosets, you will see that the partition we refer to is the set of left cosets of the set of code words.    Linear Code Triple repetition is effective, but not very efficient since its rate is quite low, . Next we consider a slightly more efficient error correcting code based on matrix multiplication. Any such code that is computed with a matrix multiplication is called a linear code . We should point out that both the parity check code and the triple repetition code are linear codes. For the parity check code, the encoding function can be thought of as acting on a row vector by multiplying times a matrix: For triple repetition, the encoding function can be thought of as acting on a matrix by multiplying times a matrix:   A Somewhat More Efficient Linear Code   The encoding that we will consider here takes a block and produces a code word of length 6. As in the triple repetition code, each code word will differ from each other code word by at least three bits. As a result, any single error will not push a code word close enough to another code word to cause confusion. Now for the details.  Let We call the generator matrix for the code, and let be our message. Define by where    Notice that since matrix multiplication is distributive over addition, we have for all . This equality, may look familiar from the definition of an isomorphism, but in this case the function is not onto. If you've read about homomorphisms, this is indeed an example of one.  One way to see that any two distinct code words have a distance from one another of at least 3 is to consider the images of any two distinct messages. If and are distinct elements of , then has at least one coordinate equal to 1. Now consider the difference between and : Whether has 1, 2, or 3 ones, must have at least three ones. This can be seen by considering the three cases separately. For example, if has a single one, two of the parity bits are also 1. Therefore, and differ in at least three bits. By the same logic as with triple repetition, a single bit error in any code word produces an element of the code space that is contained in on of the balls of radius 1 centered about a code word.  Now consider the problem of decoding received transmissions. Imagine that a code word, , is transmitted, and is received. At the receiving end, we know the formula for , and if no error has occurred in transmission, The three equations on the right are called parity-check equations. If any of them are not true, an error has occurred. This error checking can be described in matrix form.  Let   Syndrome The matrix is called the parity-check matrix for this code. Now define by . We call the syndrome of the received block. For example, and  Note that has a similar property as , that . If the syndrome of a block is , we can be almost certain that the message block is .  Next we turn to the method of correcting errors. Despite the fact that there are only eight code words, one for each three-bit block value, the set of possible received blocks is , with 64 elements. Suppose that is not a code word, but that it differs from a code word by exactly one bit. In other words, it is the result of a single error in transmission. Suppose that is the code word that is closest to and that they differ in the first bit. Then and This is the first row of !  Note that we haven't specified or , only that they differ in the first bit. Therefore, if is received, there was probably an error in the first bit and , the transmitted code word was probably and the message block was . The same analysis can be done if and differ in any of the other five bits.  In general, if the syndrome of a received string of bits is the th row of the parity check matrix, the error has occurred in the th bit.     Probability Epilog. For the two error correction examples we've looked at, we can compare their probabilities of successfully receiving all 3000 bits correctly over a binary symmetric channel with  For the triple repetition code, the probability is and the rate of this code is which means we need to transmit 9000 bits.  For the second code, the probability of success is , and rate for this code is , which means we need to transmit 6000 bits.  Clearly, there is a trade-off between accuracy and speed.  Another Linear Code  Consider the linear code with generator matrix Since is , this code encodes three bits into five bits. The natural question to ask is what detection or correction does it afford? We can answer this question by constructing the parity check matrix. We observe that if the encoding function is where addition is mod 2 addition. If we receive five bits and no error has occurred, the following two equations would be true. Notice that in general, the number of parity check equations is equal to the number of extra bits that are added by the encoding function. These equations are equivalent to the single matrix equation , where   At a glance, we can see that this code will not correct most single bit errors. Suppose an error is added in the transmission of the five bits. Specifically, suppose that 1 is added (mod 2) in position , where and the other coordinates of are 0. Then when we compute the syndrome of our received transmission, we see that But is the row of . If the syndrome is we know that the error occurred in position 1 and we can correct it. However, if the error is in any other position we can't pinpoint its location. If the syndrome is , then the error could have occurred in either position 2 or position 3. This code does detect all single bit errors but only corrects one fifth of them.      Exercises  If the error-detecting code is being used, how would you act on the following received blocks?           Error detected, since an odd number of 1's was received; ask for retransmission.  No error detected; accept this block.  No error detected; accept this block.    Determine the parity check matrix for the triple repetition code.  If the error-correcting code from this section is being used, how would you decode the following blocks? Expect an error that cannot be fixed with one of these.                 Syndrome = . Corrected coded message is and original message was .  Syndrome = . Corrected coded message is and original message was .  Syndrome = . No error, coded message is and original message was .  Syndrome = . Corrected coded message is and original message was .  Syndrome = . This syndrome occurs only if two bits have been switched. No reliable correction is possible.  Syndrome = . Corrected coded message is and original message was .    Suppose that the code words of a coding function have the property that any two of them have a Hamming distance of at least 5. How many bit errors could be corrected with such a code?  Consider the linear code defined by the generator matrix    What size blocks does this code encode and what is the length of the code words?  What are the code words for this code?  With this code, can you detect single bit errors? Can you correct all, some, or no single bit errors?    Blocks of two bits are encoded into code words of length 4.  The code words are 0000, 1010, 0111 and 1101.  Since the first two code words have a Hamming distance of 2, not all single bit errors can be corrected. For example, if 0000 is transmitted and the first bit is switch, then 1000 is received and we can't tell for sure whether this came from 0000 or 1010. To see what can be corrected, we note that is encoded to and so if is recieved and no error has occurred,   We can extract the parity check matrix from this set of equations. It is The rows of this matrix correspond with the syndromes for errors in bits 1 through 4, which are all nonzero, so we can detect any single bit error. Notice that the syndromes for bits 1 and 3 are identical. This reflects the fact that errors in these bits can't be corrected. However, the syndromes for bits 2 and 4 are unique and so we can correct them. Therefore the second bit of the original message can be sent with more confidence than the first.     Rectangular codes Rectangular codes To build a rectangular code, you partition your message into blocks of length and then factor into and arrange the bits in a rectangular array as in the figure below. Then you add parity bits along the right side and bottom of the rows and columns. The code word is then read row by row.   For example, if is 4, then our only choice is a 2 by 2 array. The message 1101 would be encoded as and the code word is the string 11001110.    Suppose that you were sent four bit messages using this code and you received the following strings. What were the messages, assuming no more than one error in the transmission of coded data?  11011000  01110010  10001111   If you encoded bits in this manner, what would be the rate of the code?  Rectangular codes are linear codes. For the 2 by 2 rectangular code, what are the generator and parity check matrices?    Suppose that the code in is expanded to add the column to the generator matrix , can all single bit errors be corrected? Explain your answer. Yes, you can correct all single bit errors because the parity check matrix for the expanded code is Since each possible syndrome of single bit errors is unique we can correct any error.   Suppose that a linear code has parity check matrix Determine the generator matrix, , and in so doing, identify the number of bits in each message block and the number of parity bits. There is a parity check equation for each parity bit.  Perfect Codes A code with minimum distance is called perfect if every string of bits is within Hamming distance of some code word. For such a code, the spheres of radius around the code words partition the set of all strings. This is analogous to packing objects into a box with no wasted space. Using just the number of bit strings of length and the number of strings in a sphere of radius , for what values of is it possible to find a perfect code of distance ? You don't have to actually find the codes.   "

This equality, may look familiar from the definition of an isomorphism, but in this case the function is not onto. If you've read about homomorphisms, this is indeed an example of one.  One way to see that any two distinct code words have a distance from one another of at least 3 is to consider the images of any two distinct messages. If and are distinct elements of , then has at least one coordinate equal to 1. Now consider the difference between and : Whether has 1, 2, or 3 ones, must have at least three ones. This can be seen by considering the three cases separately. For example, if has a single one, two of the parity bits are also 1. Therefore, and differ in at least three bits. By the same logic as with triple repetition, a single bit error in any code word produces an element of the code space that is contained in on of the balls of radius 1 centered about a code word.  Now consider the problem of decoding received transmissions. Imagine that a code word, , is transmitted, and is received. At the receiving end, we know the formula for , and if no error has occurred in transmission, The three equations on the right are called parity-check equations. If any of them are not true, an error has occurred. This error checking can be described in matrix form.  Let   Syndrome The matrix is called the parity-check matrix for this code. Now define by . We call the syndrome of the received block. For example, and  Note that has a similar property as , that . If the syndrome of a block is , we can be almost certain that the message block is .  Next we turn to the method of correcting errors. Despite the fact that there are only eight code words, one for each three-bit block value, the set of possible received blocks is , with 64 elements. Suppose that is not a code word, but that it differs from a code word by exactly one bit. In other words, it is the result of a single error in transmission. Suppose that is the code word that is closest to and that they differ in the first bit. Then and This is the first row of !  Note that we haven't specified or , only that they differ in the first bit. Therefore, if is received, there was probably an error in the first bit and , the transmitted code word was probably and the message block was . The same analysis can be done if and differ in any of the other five bits.  In general, if the syndrome of a received string of bits is the th row of the parity check matrix, the error has occurred in the th bit.    "

We observe that if the encoding function is where addition is mod 2 addition. If we receive five bits and no error has occurred, the following two equations would be true. Notice that in general, the number of parity check equations is equal to the number of extra bits that are added by the encoding function. These equations are equivalent to the single matrix equation , where   At a glance, we can see that this code will not correct most single bit errors.

  "body": " Rings, Basic Definitions and Concepts  Basic Definitions  We would like to investigate algebraic systems whose structure imitates that of the integers.  Ring  Ring  a ring with domain and operations and  A ring is a set together with two binary operations, addition and multiplication, denoted by the symbols and such that the following axioms are satisfied:   is an abelian group.  Multiplication is associative on .  Multiplication is distributive over addition; that is, for all , the left distributive law, , and the right distributive law, .       A ring is denoted or as just plain if the operations are understood.  The symbols and stand for arbitrary operations, not just regular addition and multiplication. These symbols are referred to by the usual names. For simplicity, we may write instead of if it is not ambiguous.  For the abelian group , we use additive notation. In particular, the group identity is designated by 0 rather than by and is customarily called the zero of the ring. The group inverse is also written in additive notation: rather than .     We now look at some examples of rings. Certainly all the additive abelian groups of Chapter 11 are likely candidates for rings.  The ring of integers is a ring, where and stand for regular addition and multiplication on . From Chapter 11, we already know that is an abelian group, so we need only check parts 2 and 3 of the definition of a ring. From elementary algebra, we know that the associative law under multiplication and the distributive laws are true for . This is our main example of an infinite ring.  The ring of integers modulo is a ring. The properties of modular arithmetic on were described in Section 11.4, and they give us the information we need to convince ourselves that is a ring. This example is our main example of finite rings of different orders.  Commutative Ring  Ring Commutative  A ring in which multiplication is a commutative operation is called a commutative ring.  It is common practice to use the word abelian when referring to the commutative law under addition and the word commutative when referring to the commutative law under the operation of multiplication.  Unity of a Ring  Unity of a Ring  Ring with unity  A ring that has a multiplicative identity is called a ring with unity. The multiplicative identity itself is called the unity of the ring. More formally, if there exists an element , such that for all , , then is called a ring with unity .  The rings in our first two examples were commutative rings with unity, the unity in both cases being the number 1. The ring is a noncommutative ring with unity, the unity being the two by two identity matrix.  An example of a ring that is not a ring with unity is the ring of even integers, .    Direct Products of Rings  Products of rings are analogous to products of groups or products of Boolean algebras.  Let , be rings. Let and .  From Chapter 11 we know that is an abelian group under the operation of componentwise addition: We also define multiplication on componentwise:  To show that is a ring under the above operations, we need only show that the (multiplicative) associative law and the distributive laws hold. This is indeed the case, and we leave it as an exercise. If each of the is commutative, then is commutative, and if each contains a unity, then is a ring with unity, which is the -tuple consisting of the unities of each of the 's.   Since and are rings, then is a ring, where, for example, .  To determine the unity in the ring , we look for the element such that for all elements , , or, equivalently, So we want such that in the ring . The only element in that satisfies this equation is . Similarly, we obtain value of 1 for . So the unity of , which is unique by Exercise 15 of this section, is . We leave to the reader to verify that this ring is commutative.    Multiplicative Inverses in Rings  We now consider the extremely important concept of multiplicative inverses. Certainly many basic equations in elementary algebra (e.g., ) are solved with this concept.   The equation has a solution in the ring but does not have a solution in since, to solve this equation, we multiply both sides of the equation by the multiplicative inverse of 2. This number, exists in but does not exist in . We formalize this important idea in a definition which by now should be quite familiar to you.  Multiplicative Inverses  Multiplicative Inverses  Units of a ring  the set of units of a ring Let be a ring with unity, 1. If and there exists an element such that , then is said to have a multiplicative inverse, . A ring element that possesses a multiplicative inverse is a unit of the ring. The set of all units of a ring is denoted by .  By , the multiplicative inverse of a ring element is unique, if it exists. For this reason, we can use the notation for the multiplicative inverse of , if it exists.  In the rings and every nonzero element has a multiplicative inverse. The only elements in that have multiplicative inverses are -1 and 1. That is, , , and .  Let us find the multiplicative inverses, when they exist, of each element of the ring . If , we want an element such that . We do not have to check whether since is commutative. If we try each of the six elements, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, of , we find that none of them satisfies the above equation, so 3 does not have a multiplicative inverse in . However, since , 5 does have a multiplicative inverse in , namely itself: . The following table summarizes all results for . It shouldn't be a surprise that the zero of a ring is never going to have a multiplicative inverse.   More universal concepts, isomorphisms and subrings  Isomorphism is a universal concept that is important in every algebraic structure. Two rings are isomorphic as rings if and only if they have the same cardinality and if they behave exactly the same under corresponding operations. They are essentially the same ring. For this to be true, they must behave the same as groups (under + ) and they must behave the same under the operation of multiplication.  Ring Isomorphism Ring Isomorphism.  Let and be rings. Then is isomorphic to if and only if there exists a function, , called a ring isomorphism, such that  is a bijection   for all  for all .    Conditions 1 and 2 tell us that is a group isomorphism.  This leads us to the problem of how to show that two rings are not isomorphic. This is a universal concept. It is true for any algebraic structure and was discussed in Chapter 11. To show that two rings are not isomorphic, we must demonstrate that they behave differently under one of the operations. We illustrate through several examples.  Consider the rings and . In Chapter 11 we showed that as groups, the two sets and 2 with addition were isomorphic. The group isomorphism that proved this was the function , defined by . Is a ring isomorphism? We need only check whether for all . In fact, this condition is not satisfied: Therefore, is not a ring isomorphism. This does not necessarily mean that the two rings and 2 are not isomorphic, but simply that doesn't satisfy the conditions. We could imagine that some other function does. We could try to find another function that is a ring isomorphism, or we could try to show that and 2 are not isomorphic as rings. To do the latter, we must find something different about the ring structure of and 2 .  We already know that they behave identically under addition, so if they are different as rings, it must have something to do with how they behave under the operation of multiplication. Let's begin to develop a checklist of how the two rings could differ:  Do they have the same cardinality? Yes, they are both countable.  Are they both commutative? Yes.  Are they both rings with unity? No.   is a ring with unity, namely the number 1. 2 is not a ring with unity, . Hence, they are not isomorphic as rings.  Next consider whether and are isomorphic. Because of the previous example, we might guess that they are not. However, checklist items 1 through 3 above do not help us. Why? We add another checklist item:  4. Find an equation that makes sense in both rings, which is solvable in one and not the other.  The equation , or , makes sense in both rings. However, this equation has a nonzero solution, , in , but does not have a nonzero solution in . Thus we have an equation solvable in one ring that cannot be solved in the other, so they cannot be isomorphic.  Another universal concept that applies to the theory of rings is that of a subsystem. A subring of a ring is any nonempty subset of that is a ring under the operations of . First, for to be a subring of the ring , must be a subgroup of the group . Also, must be closed under , satisfy the associative law under , and satisfy the distributive laws. But since is a ring, the associative and distributive laws are true for every element in , and, in particular, for all elements in , since . We have just proven the following theorem:   A nonempty subset of a ring is a subring of R if and only if:   is a subgroup of the group   is closed under multiplication: if , then .   The set of even integers, is a subring of the ring since is a subgroup of the group and since it is also closed with respect to multiplication:  Several of the basic facts that we are familiar with are true for any ring. The following theorem lists a few of the elementary properties of rings.  Some Basic Properties  Let be a ring, with . Then            , the last equality valid by the left distributive axiom. Hence if we add to both sides of the equality above, we obtain . Similarly, we can prove that .  Before we begin the proof of this part, recall that the inverse of each element of the group is unique. Hence the inverse of the element is unique and it is denoted . Therefore, to prove that , we need only show that inverts . Similarly, it can be shown that .  We leave the proof of part 3 to the reader as an exercise.      We will compute in the ring . , since the additive inverse of 4 (mod 6) is 2. Of course, we could have done the calculation directly as  Integral Domains and Zero Divisors  As the example above illustrates, is a modest beginning in the study of which algebraic manipulations are possible when working with rings. A fact in elementary algebra that is used frequently in problem solving is the cancellation law. We know that the cancellation laws are true under addition for any ring, based on group theory. Are the cancellation laws true under multiplication, where the group axioms can't be counted on? More specifically, let be a ring and let with . When can we cancel the 's in the equation ? We can do so if exists, but we cannot assume that has a multiplicative inverse. The answer to this question is found with the following definition and the theorem that follows.  Zero Divisor Zero Divisor Let be a ring. If and are two nonzero elements of such that , then and are called zero divisors.  In the ring , the numbers 4 and 2 are zero divisors since . In addition, 6 is a zero divisor because .  In the ring the matrices and are zero divisors since .  has no zero divisors.   Now, here is why zero divisors are related to cancellation.  Multiplicative Cancellation  The multiplicative cancellation laws hold in a ring if and only if has no zero divisors.  We prove the theorem using the left cancellation axiom, namely that if and , then for all . The proof using the right cancellation axiom is its mirror image.  Assume the left cancellation law holds in and assume that and are two elements in such that . We must show that either or . To do this, assume that and show that must be 0. .   Conversely, assume that has no zero divisors and we will prove that the left cancellation law must hold. To do this, assume that , , such that and show that .   Hence, the only time that the cancellation laws hold in a ring is when there are no zero divisors. The commutative rings with unity in which the two conditions are true are given a special name.  Integral Domain Integral Domain a generic integral domain A commutative ring with unity containing no zero divisors is called an integral domain.  In this chapter, Integral domains will be denoted generically by the letter . We state the following two useful facts without proof.  If , , then is a zero divisor if and only if and are not relatively prime; i.e., .   If p is a prime, then has no zero divisors.   , with a prime, , , and are all integral domains. The key example of an infinite integral domain is . In fact, it is from that the term integral domain is derived. Our main example of a finite integral domain is , when is prime.  We close this section with the verification of an observation that was made in Chapter 11, namely that the product of two algebraic systems may not be an algebraic system of the same type.  Both and are integral domains. Consider the direct product . It's true that is a commutative ring with unity (see Exercise 13). However, , so has zero divisors and is therefore not an integral domain.    Exercises  Review the definition of rings to show that the following are rings. The operations involved are the usual operations defined on the sets. Which of these rings are commutative? Which are rings with unity? For the rings with unity, determine the unity and all units.               All but ring d are commutative. All of the rings have a unity element. The number 1 is the unity for all of the rings except d. The unity for is the two by two identity matrix. The units are as follows:               Follow the instructions for Exercise 1 and the following rings:                   Show that the following pairs of rings are not isomorphic:   and   and .    Consider commutativity  Solve in both rings.     Show that the following pairs of rings are not isomorphic:  and .  and .     Show that is a subring of the ring  Find all subrings of .  Find all subrings of .     We already know that is a subgroup of the group . We need only show that is closed with respect to multiplication. Let . , since .

Verify the validity of by finding examples of elements , , and , in the following rings, where and yet :             Determine all solutions of the equation in . Can there be any more than two solutions to this equation (or any quadratic equation) in ?  Find all solutions of the equation in part a in . Why are there more than two solutions?     The left-hand side of the equation factors into the product . Since is an integral domain, and are the only possible solutions.  Over , 2, 3, 6, and 11 are solutions. Although the equation factors into , this product can be zero without making either 2 or 3. For example. If = 6 we get . Notice that 4 and 3 are zero divisors.    Solve the equation in the following rings. Interpret 4 as , where 1 is the unity of the ring.  in   in   in  in    The relation is isomorphic to on rings is an equivalence relation. Explain the meaning of this statement. Let , , and be any rings, then   is isomorphic to and so is isomorphic to is a reflexive relation on rings.   is isomorphic to   is isomorphic to , and so is isomorphic to is a symmetric relation on rings,   is isomorphic to , and is isomorphic to implies that is isomorphic to , and so is isomorphic to is a transitive relation on rings.  We haven't proven these properties here, just stated them. The combination of these observations implies that is isomorphic to is an equivalence relation on rings.   Let , , , be rings. Prove the multiplicative, associative, and distributive laws for the ring  If each of the is commutative, is R commutative?  Under what conditions will be a ring with unity?  What will the units of be when it has a unity?      Prove that the ring is commutative and has unity.  Determine all zero divisors for the ring .

  "body": " Fields  Although the algebraic structures of rings and integral domains are widely used and play an important part in the applications of mathematics, we still cannot solve the simple equation , in all rings or all integral domains, for that matter. Yet this is one of the first equations we learn to solve in elementary algebra and its solubility is basic to innumerable questions. If we wish to solve a wide range of problems in a system we need at least all of the laws true for rings and the cancellation laws together with the ability to solve the equation , . We summarize the above in a definition and list theorems that will place this concept in the context of the previous section.  Field Field A field is a commutative ring with unity such that each nonzero element has a multiplicative inverse.  In this chapter, we denote a field generically by the letter . The letters , and are also conventionally used for fields.  Some common fields The most common infinite fields are , , and .  Since every field is a ring, all facts and concepts that are true for rings are true for any field.  Field Integral Domain  Every field is an integral domain.  The proof is fairly easy and a good exercise, so we provide a hint. Starting with the assumption that if we assume that then the existence of makes it possible to infer that .  Of course the converse of is not true. Consider . However, the next theorem proves the converse in finite fields.  Finite Integral Domain Field Every finite integral domain is a field. We leave the details to the reader, but observe that if is a finite integral domain, we can list all elements as , where . Now, to show that any has a multiplicative inverse, consider the products . What can you say about these products?  If is a prime, . An immediate implication of this fact is the following corollary.  If p is a prime, then is a field.   A field of order 4  gives us a large number of finite fields, but we must be cautious. This does not tell us that all finite fields are of the form , a prime. To see this, let's try to construct a field of order 4.  First the field must contain the additive and multiplicative identities, 0 and 1, so, without loss of generality, we can assume that the field we are looking for is of the form . Since there are only two nonisomorphic groups of order 4, we have only two choices for the group table for . If the additive group is isomorphic to then two of the nonzero elements of would not be their own additive inverse (as are 1 and 3 in ). Let's assume is one of those elements and . An isomorphism between the additive groups and would require that in correspond with 2 in . We could continue our argument and infer that , producing a zero divisor, which we need to avoid if is to be a field. We leave the remainder of the argument to the reader. We can thus complete the addition table so that is isomorphic to :   Next, since 1 is the unity of , the partial multiplication table must look like:  Hence, to complete the table, we have only four entries to find, and, since must be commutative, this reduces our task to filling in three entries. Next, each nonzero element of must have a unique multiplicative inverse. The inverse of must be either itself or . If , then . (Why?) But . And if , then is equal to or . In either case, by the cancellation law, we obtain or , which is impossible. Therefore we are forced to conclude that and . To determine the final two products of the table, simply note that, because the equation has only two solutions, 0 and 1 in any field. We also know that cannot be 1 because doesn't invert itself and cannot be 0 because can't be a zero divisor. This leaves us with one possible conclusion, that and similarly . Hence, our multiplication table for is:  We leave it to the reader to verify that , as described above, is a field. Hence, we have produced a field of order 4. This construction would be difficult to repeat for larger fields. In section 16.4 we will introduce a different approach to constructing fields that will be far more efficient.  Even though not all finite fields are isomorphic to for some prime , it can be shown that every field must have either:  a subfield isomorphic to for some prime , or  a subfield isomorphic to .    One can think of all fields as being constructed from either or .   is a field, and it contains a subfield isomorphic to , namely itself.  The field that we constructed in has a subfield isomorphic to for some prime . From the tables, we note that the subset of under the given operations of behaves exactly like . Hence, has a subfield isomorphic to .  We close this section with a brief discussion of isomorphic fields. Again, since a field is a ring, the definition of isomorphism of fields is the same as that of rings. It can be shown that if is a field isomorphism, then ; that is, inverses are mapped onto inverses under any field isomorphism. A major question to try to solve is: How many different non-isomorphic finite fields are there of any given order? If is a prime, it seems clear from our discussions that all fields of order are isomorphic to . But how many nonisomorphic fields are there, if any, of order 4, 6, 8, 9, etc? The answer is given in the following theorem, whose proof is beyond the scope of this text.   Any finite field has order for a prime and a positive integer .  For any prime and any positive integer there is a field of order .  Any two fields of order are isomorphic.    Galois The field of order is frequently referred to as the Galois field of order and it is denoted by . Evariste Galois (1811-32) was a pioneer in the field of abstract algebra.   French stamp honoring Evariste Galois   French stamp honoring Evariste Galois    This theorem tells us that there is a field of order , and there is only one such field up to isomorphism. That is, all such fields of order 4 are isomorphic to , which we constructed in the example above.

  "body": "A field of order 4  gives us a large number of finite fields, but we must be cautious. This does not tell us that all finite fields are of the form , a prime. To see this, let's try to construct a field of order 4.  First the field must contain the additive and multiplicative identities, 0 and 1, so, without loss of generality, we can assume that the field we are looking for is of the form . Since there are only two nonisomorphic groups of order 4, we have only two choices for the group table for . If the additive group is isomorphic to then two of the nonzero elements of would not be their own additive inverse (as are 1 and 3 in ). Let's assume is one of those elements and . An isomorphism between the additive groups and would require that in correspond with 2 in . We could continue our argument and infer that , producing a zero divisor, which we need to avoid if is to be a field. We leave the remainder of the argument to the reader. We can thus complete the addition table so that is isomorphic to :   Next, since 1 is the unity of , the partial multiplication table must look like:  Hence, to complete the table, we have only four entries to find, and, since must be commutative, this reduces our task to filling in three entries. Next, each nonzero element of must have a unique multiplicative inverse. The inverse of must be either itself or . If , then . (Why?) But . And if , then is equal to or . In either case, by the cancellation law, we obtain or , which is impossible. Therefore we are forced to conclude that and . To determine the final two products of the table, simply note that, because the equation has only two solutions, 0 and 1 in any field. We also know that cannot be 1 because doesn't invert itself and cannot be 0 because can't be a zero divisor. This leaves us with one possible conclusion, that and similarly . Hence, our multiplication table for is:  We leave it to the reader to verify that , as described above, is a field. Hence, we have produced a field of order 4. This construction would be difficult to repeat for larger fields. In section 16.4 we will introduce a different approach to constructing fields that will be far more efficient. "

  "body": " Polynomial Rings  In the previous sections we examined the solutions of a few equations over different rings and fields. To solve the equation over the field of the real numbers means to find all solutions of this equation that are in this particular field . This statement can be replaced as follows: Determine all such that the polynomial is equal to zero when evaluated at . In this section, we will concentrate on the theory of polynomials. We will develop concepts using the general setting of polynomials over rings since results proven over rings are true for fields (and integral domains). The reader should keep in mind that in most cases we are just formalizing concepts that he or she learned in high school algebra over the field of reals.  Polynomial over a Ring  Polynomial over a Ring  the degree of polynomial  the set of all polynomials in over  Let be a ring. A polynomial, , over is an expression of the form where , and . If , then the degree of is . If , then the degree of is undefined, but for convenience we say that . If the degree of is , we write . The set of all polynomials in the indeterminate with coefficients in is denoted by .   The symbol is an object called an indeterminate , which is not an element of the ring .  Note that . The elements of are called constant polynomials, with the nonzero elements of being the polynomials of degree 0.  is called the ground, or base, ring for .  In the definition above, we have written the terms in increasing degree starting with the constant. The ordering of terms can be reversed without changing the polynomial. For example, and are the same polynomial.  A term of the form in a polynomial is understood to be .  It is understood that if , then coefficients of powers of higher than are equal to the zero of the base ring.   Polynomial Addition  Polynomial Addition  Let and be elements in so that and for all i. Let be the maximum of and . Then , where for .  Polynomial Multiplication  Polynomial Multiplication  Let and . Then   The important fact to keep in mind is that addition and multiplication in depends on addition and multiplication in . The powers of merely serve the purpose of place holders. All computations involving coefficients are done over the given ring. Powers of the indeterminate are computed formally applying the rule of adding exponents when multiplying powers.   , , and are all polynomials in . Their degrees are 0, 2, and 4, respectively.  Addition and multiplication of polynomials are performed as in high school algebra. However, we must do our computations in the ground ring of the polynomials.  In , if and , then and However, for the same polynomials as above, and in the more familiar setting of , we have and   Let and . We will compute in . Of course this product can be obtained by the usual methods of high school algebra. We will, for illustrative purposes, use the above definition. Using the notation of the above definition, , , , , , and . We want to compute the coefficients , , , , and . We will compute , the coefficient of the term of the product, and leave the remainder to the reader (see Exercise 2 of this section). Since the degrees of both factors is 2, for . The coefficient of is  The proofs of the following theorem are not difficult but rather long, so we omit them.  Properties of Polynomial Rings Let be a ring. Then:  is a ring under the operations of polynomial addition and multiplication.  If is a commutative ring, then is a commutative ring.  If is a ring with unity, , then is a ring with unity (the unity in is ).  If is an integral domain, then is an integral domain.  If is a field, then is not a field. However, is an integral domain.    Next we turn to division of polynomials, which is not an operation since the result is a pair of polynomials, not a single one. From high school algebra we all learned the standard procedure for dividing a polynomial by a second polynomial . This process of polynomial long division is referred to as the division property for polynomials. Under this scheme we continue to divide until the result is a quotient and a remainder whose degree is strictly less than that of the divisor . This property is valid over any field. Before giving a formal description, we consider some examples.  Polynomial Division Let and be two polynomials in . Let us divide by . Keep in mind that we are in and that, in particular, in . This is a case where reordering the terms in decreasing degree is preferred.    fig-poly-divison-1    Therefore, or equivalently, That is, where and . Notice that , which is strictly less than .   Let and be polynomials in . Let us divide by :    fig-poly-divison-2    Thus . Since we have 0 as a remainder, must be a factor of . Also, since is a factor of , 1 is a zero (or root) of . Of course we could have determined that 1 is a root of simply by computing .  Before we summarize the main results suggested by the previous examples, we should probably consider what could have happened if we had attempted to perform divisions of polynomials in the ring rather than in the polynomials over the field . For example, and are both elements of the ring , yet The quotient and remainder are not a polynomials over but polynomials over the field of rational numbers. For this reason it would be wise to describe all results over a field rather than over an arbitrary ring so that we don't have to expand our possible set of coefficients.  Division Property for Polynomials  Division Property for Polynomials  Let be a field and let and be two elements of with . Then there exist unique polynomials and in such that , where . This theorem can be proven by induction on .  The Factor Theorem  Factor Theorem  Let be a field. An element is a zero of if and only if is a factor of in .   Assume that is a zero of . We wish to show that is a factor of . To do so, apply the division property to and . Hence, there exist unique polynomials and from such that and the , so , that is, is a constant. Also, the fact that is a zero of means that . So becomes . Hence , so , and is a factor of . The reader should note that a critical point of the proof of this half of the theorem was the part of the division property that stated that .  We leave this half to the reader as an exercise.    A nonzero polynomial of degree can have at most zeros. Let be a zero of . Then , , by the Factor Theorem. If is a zero of , then again by Factor Theorem, , . Continue this process, which must terminate in at most steps since the degree of would be .  From , we can get yet another insight into the problems associated with solving polynomial equations; that is, finding the zeros of a polynomial. The initial important idea here is that the zero is from the ground field . Second, is a zero only if is a factor of in ; that is, only when can be factored (or reduced) to the product of times some other polynomial in .  Consider the polynomial taken as being in [x]. From high school algebra we know that has two zeros (or roots), namely , and can be factored as . However, we are working in , these two factors are not in the set of polynomials over the rational numbers, since . Therefore, does not have a zero in since it cannot be factored over . When this happens, we say that the polynomial is irreducible over .  The problem of factoring polynomials is tied hand-in-hand with that of the reducibility of polynomials. We give a precise definition of this concept.  Reducibility over a Field  Irreducibility of a Polynomial  Reducible Polynomial  Polynomial Irreducible  Let be a field and let be a nonconstant polynomial. is reducible over if and only if it can be factored as a product of two nonconstant polynomials in . A polynomial is irreducible over if it is not reducible over .   The polynomial is reducible over since  Is the polynomial reducible over ? Since a factorization of a cubic polynomial can only be as a product of linear and quadratic factors, or as a product of three linear factors, is reducible if and only if it has at least one linear factor. From the Factor Theorem, is a factor of over if and only if is a zero of . So is reducible over if and only if it has a zero in . Since has only two elements, 0 and 1, this is easy enough to check. and , so neither 0 nor 1 is a zero of over . Hence, is irreducible over .  From high school algebra we know that has three zeros from some field. Can we find this field? To be more precise, can we construct the field that contains and all zeros of ? We will consider this task in the next section.  We close this section with a final analogy. Prime numbers play an important role in mathematics. The concept of irreducible polynomials (over a field) is analogous to that of a prime number. Just think of the definition of a prime number. A useful fact concerning primes is: If is a prime and if , then or . We leave it to the reader to think about the veracity of the following: If is an irreducible polynomial over , and , then or .   Exercises  Let and . Compute the following sums and products in the indicated rings.   and in   and in   in   in   in    ,  ,          Complete the calculations started in .

Explain.     .   .   . (Be careful.)     Reducible,  Reducible,  Irreducible. If you could factor this polynomial, one factor would be either or , which would give you a root of 0 or 1, respectively. By substitution of 0 and 1 into this polynomial, it clearly has no roots.  Reducible,    Prove the second half of .  Give an example of the contention made in the last paragraph of this section. We illustrate this property of polynomials by showing that it is not true for a nonprime polynomial in . Suppose that , which can be reduced to , , and . Since , . However, is not a factor of either or .  Determine all zeros of in .  Show that is irreducible over but reducible over the field of real numbers. The only possible proper factors of are and , which are not in but are in [x].

Otherwise, if , we perform long division as follows, where LDT's stand for terms of lower degree than .  Therefore, Since is less than , we can apply the induction hypothesis: with .

Since has only two elements, 0 and 1, this is easy enough to check. and , so neither 0 nor 1 is a zero of over . Hence, is irreducible over . "

  "body": " Field Extensions  From high school algebra we realize that to solve a polynomial equation means to find its roots (or, equivalently, to find the zeros of the polynomials). From and we know that the zeros may not lie in the given ground field. Hence, to solve a polynomial really involves two steps: first, find the zeros, and second, find the field in which the zeros lie. For economy's sake we would like this field to be the smallest field that contains all the zeros of the given polynomial. To illustrate this concept, let us reconsider the examples from the previous section..  Extending the Rational Numbers  Let . It is important to remember that we are considering over , no other field. We would like to find all zeros of and the smallest field, call it for now, that contains them. The zeros are , neither of which is an element of . The set we are looking for must satisfy the conditions:   must be a field.   must contain as a subfield,   must contain all zeros of   By the last condition must be an element of , and, if is to be a field, the sum, product, difference, and quotient of elements in must be in . So operations involving this number, such as , , , , , and must all be elements of . Further, since contains as a subset, any element of combined with under any field operation must be an element of . Hence, every element of the form , where and can be any elements in , is an element of . We leave to the reader to show that is a field (see Exercise 1 of this section). We note that the second zero of , namely , is an element of this set. To see this, simply take and . The field is frequently denoted as , and it is referred to as an extension field of . Note that the polynomial factors into linear factors, or splits , in ; that is, all coefficients of both factors are elements of the field .  Extending Consider the polynomial . Let's repeat the steps from the previous example to factor . First, and , so none of the elements of are zeros of . Hence, the zeros of must lie in an extension field of . By , can have at most two zeros. Let be a zero of . Then the extension field of must contain, besides , , , , , and so on. But, since , we have , or equivalently, (remember, we are working in an extension of ). We can use this recurrence relation to reduce powers of . So far our extension field, , of must contain the set , and we claim that this the complete extension. For to be a field, all possible sums, products, and differences of elements in must be in . Let's try a few: Since , , which is in . Adding three 's together doesn't give us anything new: In fact, is in for all possible positive integers . Next, Therefore, and .  It is not difficult to see that is in for all positive . Does contain all zeros of ? Remember, can have at most two distinct zeros and we called one of them , so if there is a second, it must be . To see if is indeed a zero of , simply compute :   Therefore, is also a zero of . Hence, is the smallest field that contains as a subfield and contains all zeros of . This extension field is denoted by . Note that splits in ; that is, it factors into linear factors in . We also observe that is a field containing exactly four elements. By , we expected that would be of order for some prime and positive integer . Also recall that all fields of order are isomorphic. Hence, we have described all fields of order by finding the extension field of a polynomial that is irreducible over .  The reader might feel somewhat uncomfortable with the results obtained in . In particular, what is ? Can we describe it through a known quantity? All we know about is that it is a zero of and that . We could also say that , but we really expected more. However, should we expect more? In , is a number we are more comfortable with, but all we really know about it is that is the number such that . Similarly, the zero that the reader will obtain in Exercise 2 of this section is the imaginary number . Here again, this is simply a symbol, and all we know about it is that . Hence, the result obtained in is not really that strange.  The reader should be aware that we have just scratched the surface in the development of topics in polynomial rings. One area of significant applications is in coding theory.  An Error Correcting Polynomial Code  Polynomial Code  Code Polynomial  An important observation regarding the previous example is that the nonzero elements of can be represented two ways. First as a linear combination of 1 and . There are four such linear combinations, one of which is zero. Second, as powers of . There are three distinct powers and the each match up with a nonzero linear combination:   Next, we briefly describe the field and how an error correcting code can be build on a the same observation about that field.  First, we start with the irreducible polynomial over . There is another such cubic polynomial, but its choice produces essentially the same result. Just as we did in the previous example, we assume we have a zero of and call it . Since we have assumed that , we get the recurrence relation for powers that lets us reduce the seven powers , , to linear combinations of 1, , and . Higher powers will reduce to these seven, which make up the elements of a field with elements when we add zero to the set. We leave as an exercise for you to set up a table relating powers of with the linear combinations.  With this information we are now in a position to take blocks of four bits and encode them with three parity bits to create an error correcting code. If the bits are , then we reduce the expression using the recurrence relation to an expression . Since we are equating equals within , we have , or . The encoded message is , which is a representation of 0 in . If the transmitted sequence of bits is received as we reduce using the recurrence. If there was no transmission error, the result is zero. If the reduced result is zero it is most likely that the original message was . If bit is switched in the transmission, then Therefore if we reduce with the recurrence, we get the linear combination of 1, , and that is equal to and so we can identify the location of the error and correct it.   Exercises   Use the definition of a field to show that is a field.  Use the definition of vector space to show that is a vector space over .  Prove that is a basis for the vector space over , and, therefore, the dimension of over is 2.   If is nonzero, then it has a multiplicative inverse: The denominator, , is nonzero since is irrational.

In Section 8.5 we defined a generating function of a sequence with terms , , as the infinite sum  The main difference between these two expressions, disregarding notation, is that the latter is an infinite expression and the former is a finite expression. In this section we will extend the algebra of polynomials to the algebra of infinite expressions like , which are called power series.  Power Series  Power Series  the set of all powers series in  Let be a ring. A power series over is an expression of the form where . The set of all such expressions is denoted by .   Our first observation in our comparison of and is that every polynomial is a power series and so . This is true because a polynomial of degree in , can be thought of as an infinite expression where for . In addition, we will see that is a ring with subring .  is given a ring structure by defining addition and multiplication on power series as we did in , with the modification that, since we are dealing with infinite expressions, the sums and products will remain infinite expressions that we can determine term by term, as was done in with polynomials.  Power Series Addition Given power series their sum is .  Power Series Multiplication Given power series their product is .  Some Power Series Calcuations  Let be elements in . Let us compute and . First the sum: The product is a bit more involved: We can compute any value of , with the amount of time\/work required increasing as increases.   A closed-form expression for would be desirable. Using techniques from Chapter 8, the formula is , which we leave it to the reader to derive. Hence,    Properties, Units  We have seen that addition and multiplication in is virtually identical to that in . The following theorem parallels , establishing the ring properties of .  Properties of Power Series Let be a ring. Then:  is a ring under the operations of power series addition and multiplication, which depend on the operations in R.  If R is a commutative ring, then is a commutative ring.  If R is a ring with unity, , then is a ring with unity (the unity in R[x] is ).  If R is an integral domain, then is an integral domain.  If F is a field, then is not a field. However, is an integral domain.     We are most interested in the situation when the set of coefficients is a field. The theorem above indicates that when is a field, is an integral domain. A reason that is not a field is the same as one that we can cite for , namely that does not have multiplicative inverse in .  With all of these similarities, one might wonder if the rings of polynomials and power series over a field are isomorphic. It turns out that they are not. The difference between and becomes apparent when one studies which elements are units in each. First we prove that the only units in are the nonzero constants; that is, the nonzero elements of .  Polynomial Units  Polynomial Units  Units of Polynomial Rings  Let be a field. Polynomial is a unit in if and only if it is a nonzero constant polynomial.    Let be a unit in . Then has a multiplicative inverse, call it , such that . Hence, the . But . So , and since the degree of a polynomial is always nonnegative, this can only happen when the . Hence, is a constant, an element of , which is a unit if and only if it is nonzero.   If is a nonzero element of , then it is a unit since is a field. Thus it has an inverse, which is also in and so is a unit of .    Before we proceed to categorize the units in , we remind the reader that two power series and are equal if and only if corresponding coefficients are equal, for all .  Power Series Units  Power Series Units  Units of Power Series Rings  Let be a field. Then is a unit of if and only if .    If is a unit of , then there exists in such that .  Since corresponding coefficients in the equation above must be equal, , which implies that .   Assume that . To prove that is a unit of we need to find in such that . If we use the formula for the coefficients and equate coefficients, we get .  Therefore the powers series is an expression whose coefficients lie in and that satisfies the statement . Hence, is the multiplicative inverse of and is a unit.      Let be an element of . Then, by , since , is a unit and has an inverse, call it . To compute , we follow the procedure outlined in the above theorem. Using the formulas for the s, we obtain For , we have Hence, is the multiplicative inverse of .   Certainly contains a wider variety of units than . Yet is not a field, since is not a unit. So concerning the algebraic structure of , we know that it is an integral domain that contains . If we allow our power series to take on negative exponents; that is, consider expressions of the form where all but a finite number of terms with a negative index equal zero. These expressions are called extended power series. The set of all such expressions is a field, call it . This set does contain, for example, the inverse of , which is . It can be shown that each nonzero element of is a unit.    Exercises  Let and be elements of . Let . Apply basic algebra to to derive the formula for the coefficients of .

  "title": "An Introduction to Algorithms",
  "body": "An Introduction to Algorithms  Most of the algorithms in this book will contain a combination of three kinds of steps: the assignment step, the conditional step, and the loop.  Assignments In order to assign a value to a variable, we use an assignment step, which takes the form: The equals sign in most languages is used for assignment but some languages may use variations such as := or a left pointing arrow. Logical equality, which produces a boolean result and would be used in conditional or looping steps, is most commonly expressed with a double-equals, == .  An example of an assignment is k = n - 1 which tells us to subtract 1 from the value of n and assign that value to variable k . During the execution of an algorithm, a variable may take on only one value at a time. Another example of an assignment is k = k - 1 . This is an instruction to subtract one from the value of k and then reassign that value to k .   Conditional steps  Frequently there are steps that must be performed in an algorithm if and only if a certain condition is met. The conditional or \"if ... then\" step is then employed. For example, suppose that in step 2 of an algorithm we want to assure that the values of variables x and y satisfy the condition x <= y . The following step would accomplish this objective.    2. If x > y: 2.1 t = x 2.2 x = y 2.3 y = t    Steps 2.1 through 2.3 would be bypassed if the condition x > y were false before step 2.  One slight variation is the \"if ... then ... else\" step, which allows us to prescribe a step to be taken if the condition is false. For example, if you wanted to exercise today, you might look out the window and execute the following algorithm.    1. If it is cold or raining: exercise indoors else: go outside and run 2. Rest     Loops  The conditional step tells us to do something once if a logical condition is true. A loop tells us to repeat one or more steps, called the body of the loop, while the logical condition is true. Before every execution of the body, the condition is tested. The following flow diagram serves to illustrate the steps in a While loop.   Flow diagram for a while loop   Flow diagram for a while loop    Suppose you wanted to solve the equation . The following initial assignment and loop could be employed.    1. c = your first guess 2. While f(c) != 0: c = another guess    Caution: One must always guard against the possibility that the condition of a While loop will never become false. Such \"infinite loops\" are the bane of beginning programmers. The loop above could very well be such a situation, particularly if the equation has no solution, or if the variable takes on real values  In cases where consecutive integer values are to be assigned to a variable, a different loop construction, a For loop , is often employed. For example, suppose we wanted to assign variable k each of the integer values from m to n and for each of these values perform some undefined steps. We could accomplish this with a While loop:    1. k := m 2. While k <= n: 2.1 execute some steps 2.2 k = k + l    Alternatively, we can perform these steps with a For loop.    For k = m to n: execute some steps    For loops such as this one have the advantage of being shorter than the equivalent While loop. The While loop construction has the advantage of being able to handle more different situations than the For loop.    Exercises  What are the inputs and outputs of the algorithms listed in the first sentence of this section?  What is wrong with this algorithm?   Input: a and b, integers Output: the value of c will be a - b (1) c = 0 (2) While a > b: (2.1) a := a - l (2.2) c := c + l    The algorithm only works when a > b .  Describe, in words, what the following algorithm does:   Input: k, a positive integer Output: s = ? (1) s = 0 (2) While k > 0: (2.1) s = s + k (2.2) k = k - 1     Write While loops to replace the For loops in the following partial algorithms:       S = 0  for k = 1 to 5: S = S + k^2     The floor of a number is the greatest integer less than or equal to that number.    m = a positive integer greater than 1  B = floor(sqrt(m))  for i = 2 to B: if i divides evenly into m, jump to step 5  print \"m is a prime\" and exit  print \"m is composite\" and exit      Describe in words what the following algorithm does:    Input: n, a positive integer Output: k?

The default sample evaluation computes , but you can edit the final line for other inputs.   It should be fairly clear that this algorithm will successfully compute since it mimics the basic definition of exponentiation. However, this algorithm is highly inefficient. The algorithm that is most commonly used for the task of exponentiation is the following one, also implemented in Sage.   The only difficulty with the \"fast algorithm\" is that it might not be so obvious that it always works. When implemented, it can be verified by example, but an even more rigorous verification can be done using the Invariant Relation Theorem. Before stating the theorem, we define some terminology.   Proving the correctness of the fast algorithm  Pre and Post Values pre and post values of a variable  Given a variable , the pre value of , denoted , is the value before an iteration of a loop. The post value, denoted , is the value after the iteration.  Pre and post values in the fast exponentiation algorithm In the fast exponentiation algorithm, the relationships between the pre and post values of the three variables are as follows.      Invariant Relation Given an algorithm's inputs and a set of variables that are used in the algorithm, an invariant relation is a set of one or more equations that are true prior to entering a loop and remain true in every iteration of the loop.   Invariant Relation for Fast Exponentiation We claim that the invariant relation in the fast algorithm is . We will prove that this is indeed true below.  The Invariant Relation Theorem   Given a loop within an algorithm, if is a relation with the properties   R is true before entering the loop  the truth of R is maintained in any iteration of the loop  the condition for exiting the loop will always be reached in a finite number of iterations.   then R will be true upon exiting the loop.   The condition that the loop ends in a finite number of iterations lets us apply mathematical induction with the induction variable being the number of iterations. We leave the details to the reader.  We can verify the correctness of the fast exponentiation algorithm using the Invariant Relation Theorem. First we note that prior to entering the loop, . Assuming the relation is true at the start of any iteration, that is , then Finally, the value of will decrease to zero in a finite number of steps because the number of binary digits of decreases by one with each iteration. At the end of the loop, which verifies the correctness of the algorithm.    Exercises  How are the pre and post values in the slow exponentiation algorithm related?

A common form of loop is one in which a series of instructions are executed for each value of some index variable, commonly for values between two integers. Python allows a bit more generality by having structures called iterators over which looping can be done. An iterator can be as simple as a list, such as [0,1,2,3] , but also can be a power set of a finite set, as we see below, or the keys in a dictionary, which is described in the next section.  Counting Subsets  Suppose we want to count the number of subsets of that contain no adjacent elements. First, we will define our universe and its power set. The plan will be to define a function that determines whether a subset is \"valid\" in the sense that it contains no adjacent elements. Then we will iterate over the subsets, counting the valid ones. We know that the number of all subsets will be 2 raised to the number of elements in , which would be , but let's check.   The validity check in this case is very simple. For each element, , of a set, , we ask whether its successor, , is also in the set. If we never get an answer of \"True\" then we consider the set valid. This function could be edited to define validity in other ways to answer different counting questions. It's always a good idea to test your functions, so we try two tests, one with a valid set and one with an invalid one.   Finally we do the counting over our power set, incrementing the count variable with each valid set.    "

  "body": "Dictionaries  Colors of Fruits  In Python and SageMath, a dictionary is a convenient data structure for establishing a relationship between sets of data. From the point of view of this text, we can think of a dictionary as a concrete realization of a relation between two sets or on a single set. A dictionary resembles a function in that there is a set of data values called the keys , and for each key, there is a value . The value associated with a key can be almost anything, but it is most commonly a list.  To illustrate the use of dictionaries, we will define a relationship between colors and fruits. The keys will be a set of colors and values associated with each color will be a list of fruits that can take on that color. We will demonstrate how to initialize the dictionary and how to add to it. The following series of assignments have no output, so we add a print statement to verify that this cell is completely evaluated.   We distinguish a color from a fruit by capitalizing colors but not fruit. The keys of this dictionary are the colors. The keys() method returns an interator; so to get a list of keys we wrap the result with list() .   As an afterthought, we might add the information that a raspberry is red as follows. You have to be careful in that if 'Red' isn't already in the dictionary, it doesn't have a value. This is why we need an if statement.   A dictionary is iterable, with an iterator taking on values that are the keys. Here we iterate over our dictionary to output lists consisting of a color followed by a list of fruits that come in that color.   We can view a graph of this relation between colors and fruits, but the default view is a bit unconventional.   With a some additional coding we can line up the colors and fruits in their own column. First we set the positions of colors on the left with all -coordinates equal to -5 using another dictionary called vertex_pos .   Next, we place the fruit vertices in another column with -coordinates all equal to 5. In order to do this, we first collect all the fruit values into one set we call fruits .   Now the graph looks like a conventional graph for a relation between two different sets. Notice that it's not a function.    "

A matrix has an inverse if and only if its determinant is nonzero. If is a square matrix, then the determinant of is commonly denoted either or . Strictly speaking, we only need to define the determinant of a matrix here and then define the higher ordered ones recursively, but for convenience we also recall the definition of the determinant of a matrix.   Determinant of and a matrices  Determinant and a cases      If is a matrix, then  If is a matrix, then      We now proceed to define the determinant of an matrix where .

Our definition is practical in that you can apply it easily to any matrix. It isn't the most general, nor is it the best definiton for the purposes of proving properties of determinants. The more general definition is beyond our current scope, but can be easily stated with background in permutation groups.   Determinant of a Square Matrix  Determinant    The determinant of     Let be an matrix, . The determinant of is equal to     Our definition of a determinant involves what is called expansion along the first row of the matrix A. It is certainly not obvious, but it is true, that the determinant of a matrix can be found by expanding along any row or any column.   We have computed the cofactors for row 1 of above and so the determinant is only a few operations away.    Characteristic Polynomial  Associated with any square matrix, , is a characteristic polynomial which is defined to be the . The roots of this polynomial are the eigenvalues of the matrix. Here, we compute the characteristic polynomial of .  To compute the determinant we expand along the first row.    "

Let be the number of multiplications to evaluate an determinant. Then we have . To determine the value of we observe that this requires the computation of three minors, each a two by two matrix, and then a multiplication of each of them by the entries in row 1. Therefore, . Using the same logic in general, we have . The formula can be derived to be . For large this is approximately . Fortunately, there are ways to reduce the number of multiplications using properties of determinants, which we list here without proof.  Properties of Determinants  Let and be matrices, where .   can be found by expanding along any row or any column.  If two rows (or columns) of are interchanged, changes sign.

We will use SageMath to do the calculations for us. In SageMath, as in Python, numbering starts at zero, so we will describe the process using that numbering system. Let  Our strategy will be to create a column that is mostly zero so that we can expand along that column and only need to compute one cofactor. That will be the 0th column. To do that we do the following row operations. We subtract row 0 from row 1, replacing row 1 with that result. Then we subtract six time row 0 from row 2, producing a new row 2. Finally, three times row 0 is subtracted from row 3 to produce a new row 3. The SageMath code below accomplishes this and produces a new matrix, , which has the same determinant.   Expanding this matrix along the column zero, we need only compute a single three by three cofactor. We will go one step further and do row operations to get a matrix with zeros in rows 2 and 3 of column 1. The SageMath code below tells what we are doing.   We are at a point where we can do the final calculation very easily. SageMath has a determinant function, det , that we can use to verify this calculation:    "
