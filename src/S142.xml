<idx>Free Monoids and Languages</idx>

<p>In this section, we will introduce the concept of a language. Languages are subsets of a certain type of monoid, the free monoid over an alphabet.
After defining a free monoid, we will discuss languages and some of the basic problems relating to them. We will also discuss the common ways in which languages are defined.</p>
<p>Let <m>A</m> be a nonempty set, which we will call an alphabet. Our primary interest will be in the case where <m>A</m> is finite; however, <m>A</m> could be infinite for most of the situations that we will describe. The elements of <m>A</m> are called letters or symbols. Among the alphabets that we will use are <m>B=\{0,1\}</m>, and the set of ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) characters, which we symbolize as <m>ASCII</m>.</p>

<theorem xml:id="theorem-14-2-1">
<statement><p>If <m>A</m> is countable, then <m>A^*</m> is countable.</p></statement><proof>
<p> Case 1. Given the alphabet <m>B=\{0,1\}</m>, we can define a bijection from the positive integers into <m>B^*</m>. Each positive integer has a binary expansion <m>d_kd_{k-1}\cdots d_1d_0</m>, where each <m>d_j</m> is 0 or 1 and <m>d_k=1</m>. If <m>n</m> has such a binary expansion, then <m>2^k \leq n\leq 2^{k+1}</m>. We define <m>f:\mathbb{P}\to B^*</m> by <m>f(n)=f\left(d_kd_{k-1}\cdots  d_1d_0\right)=d_{k-1}\cdots d_1d_0,</m>  where  <m>f(1)=\lambda</m>. Every
one of the <m>2^k</m> strings of length <m>k</m> are the images of exactly one of the integers between <m>2^k\textrm{ and } 2^{k+1}-1.</m> From its definition, <m>f</m> is clearly a bijection; therefore, <m>B^*</m> is countable.</p>
<p>Case 2: <m>A</m> is Finite. We will describe how this case is handled with an example first and then give the general proof. If <m>A=\{a,b,c,d,e\}</m>, then we can code the letters in <m>A</m> into strings from <m>B^3</m>. One of the coding schemes (there are many) is <m>a\leftrightarrow 000, b\leftrightarrow
001, c\leftrightarrow 010, d\leftrightarrow 011, \textrm{ and } e\leftrightarrow 100</m>. Now every string in <m>A^*</m> corresponds to a different string in <m>B^*</m>; for example, <m>ace</m>.  would correspond with <m>000010100</m>. The cardinality of <m>A^*</m> is equal to the cardinality of the set of strings that can be obtained from this encoding system. The possible coded strings must be countable, since they are a subset of a countable set, <m>B^*</m>. Therefore, <m>A^*</m> is countable.</p>
<p>If <m>\lvert A\rvert =m</m>, then the letters in <m>A</m> can be coded using a set of fixed-length strings from <m>B^*</m>. If <m>2^{k-1} &lt; m \leq 2^k</m>, then there are at least as many strings of length <m>k</m> in <m>B^k</m> as there are letters in <m>A</m>. Now we can associate each letter in <m>A</m> with with a different element of <m>B^k</m>. Then any string in <m>A^*</m>.  corresponds to a string in <m>B^*</m>.  By the same reasoning as in the example above, <m>A^*</m> is countable.</p>
<p>Case 3: <m>A</m> is Countably Infinite. We will leave this case as an exercise.</p></proof></theorem>

<p>The languages of the world, English, German, Russian, Chinese, and so forth, are called natural languages. In order to communicate in writing in any one of them, you must first know the letters of the alphabet and then know how to combine the letters in meaningful ways. A  formal language is an abstraction of this situation.</p>

<theorem xml:id="theorem-14-2-2"><title>Recursive implies Generating</title>
<statement><p><ol marker="(a)">
<li><p>If <m>A</m> is countable, then there exists a generating algorithm for <m>A^*</m>.</p></li>
<li><p>If <m>L</m> is a recursive language over a countable alphabet, then there exists a generating algorithm for <m>L</m>.</p></li>
</ol>
</p>
</statement>
<proof>
<p>  Part (a) follows from the fact that <m>A^*</m> is countable; therefore, there exists a complete list of strings in <m>A^*</m>. </p>
<p>  To generate all strings of <m>L</m>, start with a list of all strings in <m>A^*</m> and an empty list, <m>W</m>, of strings in <m>L</m>. For each string <m>s</m>, use a recognition algorithm (one exists since <m>L</m> is recursive) to determine whether <m>s\in L</m>. If <m>s \in L</m>, add it to <m>W</m>; otherwise <q>throw it out.</q> Then go to the next string in the list of <m>A^*</m>.</p></proof></theorem>

<example xml:id="ex-examples-better-algorithms-q"><p>Since all of the languages in <xref ref="ex-some-formal-languages" text="local" />(d) are recursive, they must have generating algorithms. The one given in the proof of <xref ref="theorem-14-2-2" text="type-global" /> is not usually the most efficient. You could probably design more efficient generating algorithms for <m>L_2</m> and <m>L_3</m>; however, a better generating algorithm for <m>L_1</m> is not quite so obvious.</p></example> 

<p>The recognition and generation problems can vary in difficulty depending on how a language is defined and what sort of algorithms we allow ourselves to use. This is not to say that the means by which a language is defined determines whether it is recursive. It just means that the truth of the statement <q><m>L</m> is recursive</q> may be more difficult to determine with one definition than with another. We will close this section with a discussion of grammars, which are standard forms of definition for a language. When we restrict ourselves to only certain types of algorithms, we can affect our ability to determine whether <m>s\in L</m> is true. In defining a recursive language, we do not restrict ourselves in any way in regard to the type of algorithm that will be used. In the next section, we will consider machines called finite automata, which can only perform simple algorithms.</p>
<p>One common way of defining a language is by means of a <term>phrase structure grammar</term>  (or grammar, for short). The set of strings that can be produced using set of grammar rules is called a phrase structure language.</p>
<example xml:id="ex-psl-0s-before-1s"><title>Zeros before Ones</title><p> We can define the set of all strings over <m>B</m> for which all 0's precede all 1's as follows. Define the starting symbol <m>S</m> and establish rules that <m>S</m> can be replaced with any of the following: <m>\lambda</m>, <m>0S</m>, or <m>S1</m>. These replacement rules are usually
called production rules.  They are usually written in the format <m>S\to \lambda</m>, <m>S\to 0S</m>, and <m>S\to S1</m>. Now define <m>L</m> to be the set of all strings that can be produced by starting with <m>S</m> and applying the production rules until <m>S</m> no longer appears. The strings in <m>L</m> are exactly the ones that are described above.

<answer><p>
<ol marker="(a)">
<li><p>List the elements of each set <m>X_i</m>  in a sequence <m>x_{i 1}</m>, <m>x_{i 2}</m>, <m>x_{i 3}\ldots</m> .   
Then draw arrows as shown below and list the elements of the union in order established by this pattern:  <m>x_{11}</m>, <m>x_{21}</m>, <m>x_{12}</m>, <m>x_{13}</m>,
