<subsection><title>Properties</title>
<p>Consider the following functions:</p>
<p>Let <m>A = \{1, 2, 3, 4\}</m> and <m>B = \{a, b, c, d\}</m>, and define <m>f:A \rightarrow  B</m> by 
<me>f(1) = a, f(2) = b, f(3) = c \textrm{ and } f(4) = d</me>
</p>
<p>Let <m>A = \{1, 2, 3, 4\}</m> and <m>B = \{a, b, c, d\}</m>, and define <m>g:A \rightarrow  B</m> by 
<me>g(1) = a , g(2) = b, g(3) = a \textrm{ and } g(4) = b.</me>
</p>

<p>The first function, <m>f</m>, gives us more information about the set <m>B</m> than the second function, <m>g</m>. Since <m>A</m> clearly has four elements, <m>f</m> tells us that <m>B</m> contains at least four elements since each element of <m>A</m> is mapped onto a different element of <m>B</m>. The properties that <m>f</m> has, and <m>g</m> does not have, are the most basic properties that we look for in a function. The following definitions summarize the basic vocabulary for function properties.</p>

<definition xml:id="def-injective-function"><title>Injective Function, Injection</title><idx><h>Function</h><h>Injective</h></idx><idx><h>Function</h><h>One-to-one</h></idx><idx>Injection</idx>
<statement><p>A function <m>f: A \rightarrow B</m> is injective if 
<me>\forall a, b\in  A, a\neq b \Rightarrow  f(a) \neq  f(b)</me>
An injective function is called an injection, or a one-to-one function.</p></statement></definition>

<p>Notice that the condition for an injective function is logically equivalent to
  <me> f(a) = f(b) \Rightarrow   a = b</me>. 
for all <m>a, b\in  A</m>.  This is often a more convenient condition to prove than what is given in the definition.</p>

<definition xml:id="def-surjective-function"><title>Surjective Function, Surjection</title><idx><h>Function</h><h>Surjective</h></idx><idx><h>Function</h><h>Onto</h></idx><idx>Surjection</idx>
<statement><p>A function <m>f: A \rightarrow B</m> is surjective if its range, <m>f(A)</m>, is equal to its codomain, <m>B</m>.  A surjective function is called a surjection, or an onto function.</p></statement></definition>
  <p>Notice that the condition for a surjective function is equivalent to 
<me>\textrm{For all } b \in  B\textrm{, there exists } a\in A \textrm{ such that } f(a)=b</me>.</p>

<definition xml:id="def-bijective-function">
<title>Bijective Function, Bijection</title>
<idx><h>Function</h><h>Bijective</h></idx>
<idx>Bijection</idx>
<statement><p> A function <m>f: A \rightarrow B</m> is bijective if it is both injective and surjective. Bijective functions are also called one-to-one, onto functions.</p></statement></definition>
<p>The function <m>f</m> that we opened this section with is bijective. The function <m>g</m> is neither injective nor
surjective.</p>
<example xml:id="ex-injective-notsurjective"><title>Injective but not surjective function</title><p>Let <m>A = \{1, 2, 3\}</m> and <m>B = \{a, b, c, d\}</m>, and define <m>f:A \rightarrow  B</m> by <m>f(1) = b</m>, <m>f(2) = c</m>, and <m>f(3)
= a</m>. Then <m> f </m> is injective but not surjective.</p></example> 
<example xml:id="ex-characteristic-properties"><title>Characteristic Functions</title><p>The characteristic function, <m>\chi _S</m>, in <xref ref="exercise-characteristic-function" text="type-global" />  is surjective if <m>S</m> is a proper subset of <m>A</m>, but never injective if <m>\lvert A \rvert \gt 2</m>.</p></example> 
</subsection>
<subsection><title>Counting</title>
<example xml:id="ex-classroom"><title>Seating Students</title><p>Let <m>A</m> be the set of students who are sitting in a classroom,  let <m>B</m> be the set of seats in the classroom, and let <m>s</m> be the function which maps each student into the chair he or she is sitting in. When is <m>s</m> one to one? When is it onto? Under normal circumstances, <m>s</m>  would always be injective since no two different students would be in the same seat.  In order for <m>s</m> to be surjective, we need all seats to be used, so <m>s</m>  is a surjection if the classroom is filled to capacity.</p>
</example> 
<p>Functions can also be used for counting the elements in large finite sets or in infinite sets. Let's say we wished to count the occupants in an auditorium containing 1,500 seats. If each seat is occupied, the answer is obvious, 1,500 people. What we have done is to set up a one-to-one correspondence, or bijection, from seats to people. We formalize in a definition.</p>
<definition xml:id="def-cardinality"><title>Cardinality</title><idx>Cardinality.</idx><notation><usage><m>\lvert A \rvert = n</m></usage><description><m>A</m> has cardinality <m>n</m></description></notation><statement><p>Two sets are said to have the same cardinality if there exists a bijection between them. If a set has the same cardinality as the set <m>\{1,2,3,\ldots , n\}</m>, then we say its cardinality is <m>n</m>.  </p></statement></definition>
<p>The function <m>f</m> that opened this section serves to show that the two sets <m>A=\{1, 2, 3, 4\}</m> and <m>B=\{a, b, c, d\}</m> have the same cardinality. Notice in applying the definition of cardinality, we don't actually appear to count either set, we just match up the elements. However, matching the letters in <m>B</m> with the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4 is precisely how we count the letters.</p>
<definition xml:id="def-countable-set"><title>Countable Set</title><idx>Countable Set</idx><statement><p>If a set is finite or has the same cardinality as the set of positive integers, it is called a countable set.</p></statement></definition> 

<example xml:id="ex-the-alphabet"><title>Counting the Alphabet</title><p> The alphabet <m>\{A, B, C, . . . , Z\}</m> has cardinality 26 through the following bijection into the set <m>\{1,2,3,\ldots ,26\}</m>.
<me>
\begin{array}{ccccc}
 A &amp; B &amp; C &amp; \cdots  &amp; Z \\
 \downarrow  &amp; \downarrow  &amp; \downarrow  &amp; \cdots  &amp; \downarrow  \\
 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; \cdots  &amp; 26 \\
\end{array}
</me>.</p></example>



<example xml:id="ex-evens-eq-all"><title>As many evens as all positive integers</title><p>Recall that <m>2\mathbb{P}= \{b\in \mathbb{P} \mid b= 2k \textrm{ for some } k \in \mathbb{P} \}</m>.  Paradoxically, <m>2\mathbb{P}</m>  has the same cardinality as the set <m>\mathbb{P}</m> of positive integers. To prove this, we must find a bijection from <m>\mathbb{P}</m> to <m>2\mathbb{P}</m>.  Such a function isn't unique, but this one is the simplest: <m>f:\mathbb{P} \rightarrow  2\mathbb{P}</m> where <m>f(m) = 2m</m>.  Two statements must be proven to justify our claim that <m>f</m> is a bijection:</p>
<p><ul>
<li><p> <m>f</m> is one-to-one.</p>
<p>Proof: Let <m>a, b \in  \mathbb{P}</m> and assume that <m>f(a) = f(b)</m>. We must prove that <m>a = b</m>. 
<me> f(a) = f(b) \Longrightarrow  2a = 2b \Longrightarrow  a = b.</me> </p></li>
<li><p><m> f </m> is onto.</p>
<p>Proof:  Let <m>b \in  2\mathbb{P}</m>. We want to show that there exists an element <m>a \in  \mathbb{P}</m> such that <m>f(a) = b</m>. If <m>b \in 
2\mathbb{P}</m>, <m>b = 2k</m> for some <m>k \in  \mathbb{P}</m> by the definition of <m>2\mathbb{P}</m>. So we have <m>f(k) = 2k = b</m>. Hence, each element
of 2<m>\mathbb{P}</m> is the image of some element of <m>\mathbb{P}</m>. </p></li>
</ul></p>
</example> 

<p>Another way to look at any function with <m>\mathbb{P}</m> as its domain is creating a list of the form <m>f(1),f(2), f(3), \ldots</m>.  In the previous example, the list  is <m>2, 4, 6, \ldots</m>.  This infinite list clearly has no duplicate entries and every even positive integer appears in the list eventually.</p>

<p>A function <m>f:\mathbb{P}\to A</m> is a bijection if the infinite list <m>f(1), f(2), f(3), \ldots</m> contains no duplicates, and every element of <m>A</m> appears once in the list.  In this case, we say the <m>A</m> is <term>countably infinite</term>, or simply <term>countable</term>.</p>

<example xml:id="ex-infinity-paradox-1"><title>A First Paradox of Infinity</title><p>When studying infinity, paradoxes abound.  One of the first instances of this is when we observe that the set of even positive integers, in spite of the fact that they make up only half of the positive integers, has the same cardinality as the whole set of positive integers.  This follows from our definition of cardinality  with the function <m>f(k)=2k</m>, which is a bijection from the positive integers to the even positive integers. We can make a similar observation that the seemingly smaller set of powers of <m>10</m>, <m>\{10^0,10^1,10^2,10^3,\dots\}</m>, also has the same cardinality as the positive integer. Here, the function <m>g(k)=10^k</m> serves as our justification.</p>
<p>Going in the opposite direction, there are seemingly larger sets than the positive integer that are countably infinite.  One such example is the Cartesian product of the positive integers with itself, <m>\mathbb{P}\times \mathbb{P}</m>. A function that justifies this claim doesn't have such a neat formula, but it would start like this:
</p>
<table>
	<title></title>
<tabular>
	<row><cell colspan='4'><m>f(1)=(1,1)</m></cell>
	</row>
	<row><cell><m>f(2)=(1,2)</m></cell><cell colspan='3'><m>f(3)=(2,1)</m></cell>
	</row>
	<row><cell><m>f(4)=(1,3)</m></cell><cell><m>f(5)=(2,2)</m></cell><cell colspan='2'><m>f(6)=(3,1)</m></cell>
	</row>
	<row><cell><m>f(7)=(1,4)</m></cell><cell><m>f(8)=(2,3)</m></cell><cell><m>f(9)=(3,2)</m></cell><cell><m>f(10)=(4,1)</m></cell>
	</row>
</tabular>
</table>
<p>See the pattern?  If it continues, every positive integer will map to a different pair and every pair of positive integer will be in the range of <m>f</m>.</p>
</example> 

<p>Readers who have studied real analysis should recall that the set of rational numbers is a countable set, while the set of real numbers is not a
countable set. See the exercises at the end of this section for an another example of such a set.</p>

<p>We close this section with a theorem called the Pigeonhole Principle, which has numerous applications even though it is an obvious, common-sense statement. Never underestimate the importance of simple ideas. The Pigeonhole Principle states that if there are more pigeons than
pigeonholes, then two or more pigeons must share the same pigeonhole. A more rigorous mathematical statement of the principle follows.</p>

<theorem xml:id="th-pigeonhole-principle"><title>The Pigeonhole Principle</title><idx>Pigeonhole Principle</idx><statement><p>Let <m>f</m> be a function from a finite set <m>X</m> into a finite set <m>Y</m>. If <m>n\geq 1</m> and <m>\lvert X\rvert > n\lvert Y\rvert</m>, then there exists an element of <m>Y</m> that is the image under <m>f</m> of at least <m>n + 1</m> elements of X.</p></statement>
<proof><p>Assume no such element exists. For each <m>y \in Y</m>, let <m>A_y = \{x\in X \mid f(x) =y \}</m>.  Then it must be that <m>\lvert A_y \rvert \leq n</m>.  Furthermore, the set of nonempty <m>A_y</m> form a partition of <m>X</m>.   Therefore,  
<me> \lvert X \rvert = \sum_{y\in Y}{\lvert A_y \rvert} \leq n \lvert Y \rvert </me>
which is a contradiction.</p>
</proof></theorem>

<example xml:id="ex-names"><title>A duplicate name is assured</title><p>Assume that a room contains four students with the first names John, James, and Mary. Prove that two students have the same first name. We can visualize a mapping from the set of students to the set of first names; each student has a first name. The pigeonhole principle applies with <m>n = 1</m>, and we can conclude that at least two of the students have the same first name.</p>

  In the first row list all nonnegative rationals with denominator 1,

    In this listing, of course, there are duplications, for example, <m>0/1=0/2=0</m>,

<exercise number="11"><statement><p> Use the Pigeonhole Principle to prove that an injection cannot exist between a finite set <m>A</m> and a finite set <m>B</m> if the
cardinality of <m>A</m> is greater than the cardinality of <m>B</m>.</p>
</statement><answer><p> Let <m>f</m> be any function from <m>A</m> into <m>B</m>. By the Pigeonhole principle with <m>n=1</m>, there exists an element of <m>B</m> that is the image of at least two elements of <m>A</m>. Therefore, <m>f</m> is not an injection.

<exercise number="12"><statement><p> The important properties of relations are not generally of interest for functions. Most functions are not reflexive, symmetric, antisymmetric,
or transitive. Can you give examples of functions that do have these properties?</p>
</statement>
<answer component="im">
<p>Here are a few examples.</p><p>Given any domain <m>U</m>, the only function that is reflexive is the function <m>i</m>, defined by <m>i(a)=a</m> for all <m>a\in U</m>. This is the <xref ref="def-identity-function" text="type-global"/>, which is formally introduced in the next section.  This function has the other three properties, and is the equality relation on <m>U</m>. There are other functions have some of the individual properties.  For example, on the integer, the function <m>f</m> defined by <m>f(k)=-k</m> is symmetric. The function <m>g</m> defined by <m>g(k)=k+1</m> is antisymmetric. A constant function such as the function that maps each integer to zero is transitive, but not very interesting as far as transitivity is concerned..</p>

<exercise number="13"><statement><p> Prove that the set of all infinite sequences of 0's and 1's is not a countable set. </p>
</statement>
<answer><p> The proof is indirect and follows a technique called the Cantor diagonal process.
 Assume to the contrary that the set is countable, then the elements can be listed:

 <m>n_1,n_2,n_3,\ldots</m> where each <m>n_i</m> is an infinite sequence of 0s and 1s. Consider the array:
<me>
\begin{array}{c}
n_1=n_{11}n_{12}n_{13}\cdots\\
n_2=n_{21}n_{22}n_{23}\cdots\\
n_3=n_{31}n_{32}n_{33}\cdots\\
\quad \vdots\\
\end{array}
</me> 
</p>
   <p>We assume that this array contains all infinite sequences of 0s and 1s. Consider the sequence <m>s</m> defined by

<m>s_i=\begin{cases}
 0 &amp; \textrm{ if } n_{\textrm{ii}}=1 \\
 1 &amp; \textrm{ if } n_{\textrm{ii}}=0
\end{cases}</m>
</p>
<p>Notice that <m>s</m> differs from each <m>n_i</m> in the <m>i</m>th position and so cannot be in the list. This is a contradiction, which completes our proof.</p>

<exercise number="14"><statement><p> Prove that the set of all functions on the integers is an uncountable set.</p>
</statement>
<answer component="im">
<p>We prove that the set is uncountable by contradiction.  Assume there is a bijection <m>\mathcal{F}</m> from the positive integers into the set of all functions on the integers.  We can define a function <m>F</m> that is not in the range of <m>\mathcal{F}</m>, contradicting our assumption that <m>\mathcal{F}</m> is a bijection.  Our definition is <m>F(k)=(\mathcal{F}(k))(k)+1</m>.  Notice that <m>F \neq \mathcal{F}(k)</m> because they map <m>k</m> to different values.</p>
