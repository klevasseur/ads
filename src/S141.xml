<p>Recall the definition of a monoid from Chapter 11.</p>

<definition xml:id="def-monoid"><title>Monoid</title><index><main>Monoid</main></index>
<statement><p>A monoid is a set \(M\) together with a binary operation \(*\) with the properties
<ul>
<li><p> \(*\) is associative:  \((a*b)*c=a*(b*c) \forall a,b,c \in M\), and</p></li>
<li><p> \(*\) has an identity in \(M\):  \(\exists e\in M\) such that \(a*e=e*a=a \forall a \in M\)</p></li>
</ul></p></statement></definition> 

<note><p>Since the requirements for a group contain the requirements for a monoid, every group is a monoid.</p></note>

<example xml:id="ex-some-monoids"><title>Some Monoids</title>
<p><ol label="a">
<li><p>  The power set of any set together with any one of the operations intersection, union, or symmetric difference is a monoid.</p></li>
<li><p>  The set of integers, <m>\mathbb{Z}</m>, with multiplication, is a monoid. With addition, <m>\mathbb{Z}</m> is also a monoid.</p></li>
<li><p> The set of \(n\times n\) matrices over the integers, \(M_n(\mathbb{Z})\), \(n\geq 2\), with matrix multiplication, is a monoid. This follows from the fact that matrix multiplication is associative and has an identity, \(I_n\). This is an example of a noncommutative monoid since there are
matrices, <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>, for which \(A B \neq B A\).</p></li>
<li><p> \(\left[\mathbb{Z}_n,\times_n\right],n\geqslant 2\), is a monoid with identity 1. </p></li>
<li><p>  Let \(X\) be a nonempty set. The set of all functions from <m>X</m> into <m>X</m>, often denoted \(X^X\) , is a monoid over function
composition. In Chapter 7, we saw that function composition is associative. The function \(i:X\to X\) defined by \(i(a)=a\) is the identity element
for this system. This is another example of a noncommutative monoid, provided \(\lvert X\rvert\) is greater than 1.
If <m>X</m> is finite, \(\left\lvert X^X\right\rvert =\lvert X\rvert ^{\lvert X\rvert }\) . For example, if \(B=\{0,1\}, \left\lvert B^B\right\rvert=4\). The functions \(z,u,i,\textrm{ and } t,\) defined by the graphs in <xref ref="fig-functions-on-B2" autoname="yes" />, are the elements of \(B^B\) . This monoid is not a group. Do you know why?</p>
<p>One reason why \(B^B\) is noncommutative is that \(t \circ z \neq z \circ t\) because \((t\circ z)(0)=t(z(0))=t(0)=1\) while \((z\circ t)(0)=z(t(0))=z(1)=0\).</p></li>

<p>Virtually all of the group concepts that were discussed in Chapter 11 are applicable to monoids. When we introduced subsystems, we saw that a submonoid of monoid <m>M</m> is a subset of <m>M</m>; that is, it is a monoid with the operation of <m>M</m>. To prove that a subset is a submonoid, you can apply the following theorem.</p>

<theorem xml:id="th-submonoid"><title>Submonoid Test</title>
<statement><p>Let  \([M; *]\)  be a monoid and \(K\) is a nonempty subset of \(M\), \(K\) is a submonoid of \(M\) if and only
if:
<ul>
<li><p>If \(a,b\in K\), then.  \(a*b\in K\); i. e., \(K\)  is closed with under \(*\).</p></li>
<li><p>the identity of \(M\) belongs to \(K\).</p></li>
</ul></p></statement>
</theorem>

<p>Often we will want to discuss the smallest submonoid that includes a certain subset <m>S</m> of a monoid <m>M</m>. This submonoid can be defined recursively by the following definition.</p>

<definition xml:id="def-submonoid-generated-by-a-set"><title>Submonoid Generated by a Set</title><index><main>Submonoid</main><sub>Generated by a Set</sub></index>
<statement><p>If S is a subset of monoid \([M;*]\), the submonoid generated by S, \(\langle S\rangle\), is defined by:. <ol label="a">
<li><p>  (Basis) The identity of <m>M</m> belongs to \(\langle
S\rangle\); and
 \(a\in S \Rightarrow a\in \langle S \rangle\), and (ii. ) </p></li>
<li><p> (Recursion). , \(a,b\in \langle S\rangle \Rightarrow a*b\in \langle S\rangle\).</p></li></ol></p></statement></definition>

 

<note><p> If \(S=\left\{a_1,a_2,\ldots ,a_n\right\}\), we write \(\left\langle a_1,a_2,\ldots ,a_n\right\rangle\) in place of \(\left\langle \left\{a_1,a_2,\ldots
,a_n\right\}\right\rangle\).</p></note>

<example xml:id="ex-some-submonoids"><title>Some Submonoids</title><p><ol label="a">
<li><p>One example of a submonoid of \([\mathbb{Z};+] is \langle 2\rangle =\{0,2,4,6,8,\ldots \}\)</p></li>
<li><p> The power set of \(\mathbb{Z},\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{Z}),\) over union is a monoid with identity \(\emptyset\). If \(S=\{\{1\},\{2\},\{3\}\}\),then \(\langle S \rangle\) is the power set of \(\{1,2,3\}\). If \(S=\{\{n\}:n\in \mathbb{Z}\},\) then \(\langle S\rangle\) is the set of finite subsets of the integers.</p></li>
</ol>
</p></example>

<p>As you might expect, two monoids are isomorphic if and only if there exists a translation rule between them so that any true proposition in one monoid is translated to a true proposition in the other.</p>

<example xml:id="ex-14.1.3."><title>14.1.3.</title>
<p>\(M=[\mathcal{P}\{1,2,3\},\cap  ]\) is isomorphic to \(M_2=\left[\mathbb{Z}_2^3;\cdot \right]\), where the operation in \(M_2\) is componentwise mod 2.  multiplication. A translation rule is that if \(A\subseteq \{1,2,3\}\), then it is translated to \(\left(d_1,d_2,d_3\right)\) where 
<me>d_i=\left\{
\begin{array}{cc}
 1 &amp; \textrm{ if } i\in A \\
 0 &amp; \textrm{ if } i\notin A \\
\end{array}
\right.</me> 

 Two cases of how this translation rule works are:

<me>
\begin{array}{lr}
			\begin{array}{c}
			\{1, 2, 3\}\quad\textrm{ is the identity for } M_1\\
			 \updownarrow   \\
			(1,1,1) \quad\textrm{ is the identity for }M_2\\
			\end{array} 
	&amp;     
		\begin{array}{c}
		 \{1, 2\}\cap \{ 2, 3\}=\{2\}\\
			\updownarrow \\       
		(1, 1, 0) \cdot  (0, 1, 1) = (0, 1, 0)\\
		\end{array}\\
               \quad
\end{array}
</me></p></example>  

<p>A more precise definition of a monoid isomorphism is identical to the definition of a group isomorphism, <xref ref="def-group-isomorphism" />.</p>

<title>Exercises for Section 14.1</title>
<exercise number="1"><statement><p>  For each of the subsets of the indicated monoid, determine whether the subset is a sub monoid.
<ol label="a">
<li><p> \(S_1=\{0,2,4,6\}\) and  \(S_2=\{1,3,5,7\}\) in \([\mathbb{Z}_8;\times_8].\)</p></li>
<li><p> \(\{f\in \mathbb{N}^{\mathbb{N}}:f(n) \leqslant n, \forall n \in \mathbb{N}\}\) and  \(\left\{f\in \mathbb{N}^{\mathbb{N}}:f(1)=2\right\}\) in the monoid \([\mathbb{N}^{\mathbb{N}};\circ]\).</p></li>
<li><p> \(\{A\subseteq \mathbb{Z} \mid A \textrm{ is finite}\} \textrm{ and} \left\{A\subseteq \mathbb{Z} \mid A^c\textrm{ is} \textrm{ finite}\right\}\) in \([\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{Z});\cup].\)</p></li>
</ol>
</p></statement>
<answer><p>
<ol label="a">
<li><p> \(S_1\) is not a submonoid since the identity of \(\left[\mathbb{Z}_8 ,\times_8\right]\), which is 1, is not in \(S_1\).   \(S_2\) is a submonoid since \(1 \in  S_2\) and \(S_2\) is closed under multiplication; that is, for all \(a, b \in  S_2\), \(a \times_8 b\) is in \(S_2\).</p></li>
<li><p>The identity of \(\mathbb{N}^{\mathbb{N}}\) is the identity function \(i:\mathbb{N}\to \mathbb{N}\) defined by \(i(a) = a\), \(\forall a\in \mathbb{N}\).  If \(a \in \mathbb{N}\), \(i(a) = a \leq  a\), thus the identity of \(\mathbb{N}^{\mathbb{N}}\) is in \(S_1\). However, the image of 1 under any
function in \(S_2\) is 2, and thus the identity of \(\mathbb{N}^{\mathbb{N}}\) is not in \(S_2\), so \(S_2\) is not a submonoid. The composition of any two functions in \(S_1\),  <m>f</m> and <m>g</m>, will be a function in \(S_1\):
<me>
\begin{split}
(f\circ g)(n) &amp; = f(g(n)) \leq g(n)\textrm{      since } f \textrm{ is in } S_1\\
		&amp; \leq n\textrm{       since } g \textrm{ is in } S_1 \Rightarrow (f\circ g\in S_1\)\\

and the two conditions of a submonoid are satisfied and \(S_1\) is a submonoid of  \(\mathbb{N}^{\mathbb{N}}\).</p></li>
<li><p>The first set is a submonoid, but the second is not since the null set has a non-finite complement.</p></li>

<exercise number="3"><statement><p>An \(n \times n\)  matrix of real numbers is called <term>stochastic</term> if and only if each entry is nonnegative
and the sum of} entries in each column is  1. Prove that the set of stochastic matrices is a monoid over matrix multiplication.</p></statement>
<answer><p>The set of \(n \times  n\) real matrices is a monoid under matrix multiplication. This follows from the laws of matrix algebra in Chapter 5. To prove that the set of stochastic matrices is a monoid over matrix multiplication, we need only show that the identity matrix is stochastic (this is obvious) and that the set of stochastic matrices is closed under matrix multiplication. Let <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> be \(n \times  n\) stochastic matrices.
 \[(AB)_{i j}= \sum _{k=1}^n a_{i k} b_{k j}\]
</p>
<p>The sum of the \(j^{\textrm{th}}\) column is
<me>
\begin{split}
\sum_{j=1}^n (AB)_{i j} &amp; =\sum_{k=1}^n a_{1 k} b_{k j}+\sum_{k=1}^n a_{1k} b_{k j}+\cdots +\sum_{k=1}^n a_{n k} b_{k j}\\
	&amp;=\sum_{k=1}^n \left(a_{1 k} b_{k j}+a_{1k} b_{k j}+\cdots +a_{n k} b_{k j}\right)\\

<exercise number="4"><statement><p> A <term>semigroup</term> is an algebraic system \([S; *]\) with the only axiom that \(*\) be associative on \(S\). Prove that if <m>S</m> is a finite set, then there must exist an idempotent element, that is, an \(a \in  S\) such that \(a * a = a\).</p></statement>
</exercise>
<exercise number="5"><statement><p>  Let <m>B</m> be a Boolean algebra and <m>M</m> the set of all Boolean functions on <m>B</m>. Let \(*\) be defined on <m>M</m> by \((f * g)(a) = f(a) \land  g(a)\). Prove that \([M,*]\) is a monoid. Construct the operation table of \([M,*]\) for the case of \(B = B_2\).</p>
</statement>
<answer><p> Let \(f, g, h \in  M\), and \(a \in  B\).
<me>
\begin{split}
((f*g)*h)(a) &amp; = (f*g)(a) \land  h(a)\\
		&amp; =  (f(a)\land g(a))\land h(a)\\
		&amp; =  f(a) \land ( g(a) \land  h(a))\\
		&amp; =  f(a) \land  (g * h)(a)\\
		&amp; =  (f * (g * h))(a)\\
\end{split}
</me>

Therefore \((f * g) * h =f * (g * h) and  \(*\) is  associative.</p>
<p>The identity for \(*\) is the function \(u \in  M\) where \(u(a) = 1\) = the <q>one</q> of <m>B</m>. If \(a \in  B\),
\((f*u)(a) =f(a)\land u(a) = f(a)\land 1 = f(a)\). Therefore \(f * u = f\). Similarly, \(u * f =f\).</p>
<p>There are \(2^2= 4\) functions in \(M\) for \(B = B _2\). These four functions are named in the text (see <xref ref="fig-functions-on-B2" autoname="yes" />). The table for \(*\) is

\[\begin{array}{c|cccc}

 z &amp;z &amp; z &amp; z &amp; z \\
 i &amp;z &amp; i &amp; z &amp; i \\
