<p>The subsystem is a fundamental concept of algebra at the universal level.</p>

<definition xml:id="def-subsystem"><title>Subsystem</title>
<index><main>Subsystem</main></index>
<notation><usage>W \leq  V</usage><description><m>W</m> is a subsystem of <m>V</m></description></notation>
<statement><p>If \(\left[V; *_1, \ldots ,*_n\right]\) is an algebraic system of a certain kind and \(W\) is a subset of \(V\), then \(W\) is a subsystem of \(V\) if \(\left[W; *_1, \ldots ,*_n\right]\) is an algebraic system of the same kind as \(V\). The usual notation for <q>\(W\) is a subsystem of \(V\)</q> is \(W \leq V\).</p>
</statement></definition>

<p>Since the definition of a subsystem is at the universal level, we can cite examples of the concept of subsystems at both the axiomatic and concrete
level.</p>

<example xml:id="ex-subsystems"><title>Examples of Subsystems</title>
<p><ol label="a">
<li><p>  (Axiomatic) If \([G; *]\) is a group, and <m>H</m> is a subset of <m>G</m>, then <m>H</m> is a subgroup of <m>G</m> if \([H; *]\)
is a group.</p></li>
<li><p>  (Concrete) \(U = \{-1,1\}\) is a subgroup of \(\left[\mathbb{R}^*;\cdot \right]\). Take the time now to write out the multiplication table
of \(U\) and convince yourself that \([U;\cdot ]\) is a group.</p></li>
<li><p>  (Concrete) The even integers, \(2\mathbb{Z} = \{2k : k \textrm{ is} \textrm{ an} \textrm{ integer}\}\) is a subgroup of \([\mathbb{Z}; +]\). Convince
yourself of this fact.</p></li>
<li><p>  (Concrete) The set of nonnegative integers is not a subgroup of \([\mathbb{Z}; +]\). All of the group axioms are true for this subset except
one: no positive integer has a positive additive inverse. Therefore, the inverse property is not true. Note that every group axiom must be true for
a subset to be a subgroup.</p></li>
<li><p>  (Axiomatic) If <m>M</m> is a monoid and <m>P</m> is a subset of <m>M</m>, then <m>P</m> is a submonoid of <m>M</m> if \(P\) is a monoid.</p></li>
<li><p>  (Concrete) If \(B^*\) is the set of strings of 0's and 1's of length zero or more with the operation of concatenation, then two examples of
submonoids of \(B^*\) are: (i) the set of strings of even length, and (ii) the set of strings that contain no 0's. The set of strings of length less
than 50 is not a submonoid because it isn't closed under concatenation. Why isn't the set of strings of length 50 or more a submonoid of \(B^*\)?</p></li>
</ol>
</p></example>


<p>For the remainder of this section, we will concentrate on the properties of subgroups. The first order of business is to establish a systematic way of determining whether a subset of a group is a subgroup.</p>

<theorem xml:id="th-subgroup-conditions"><title>Subgroup Conditions</title>
<statement>
<p>To determine whether H, a subset of group \([G;*]\), is a subgroup, it is sufficient to prove:
<ol label="a">
<li><p>  H is closed under \(*\); that is, \(a, b \in  H \Rightarrow a * b \in  H\);</p></li>
<li><p>  H contains the identity element for \(*\); and</p></li>
<li><p>  H contains the inverse of each of its elements; that is,  \(a\in  H \Rightarrow a^{-1}\in  H\).</p></li>
</ol>
</p>
</statement>
<proof><p>Our proof consists of verifying that if the three properties above are true, then all the axioms of a group are true for \([H ; *]\). By
Condition (a), \(*\) can be considered an operation on <m>H</m>. The associative, identity, and inverse properties are the axioms that are needed. The identity and inverse properties are true by conditions (b) and (c), respectively, leaving only the associative property. Since, \([G; *]\) is a group, \(a * (b * c) = (a * b) * c\) for all \(a, b, c \in  G\). Certainly, if this equation is true for all choices of three elements from <m>G</m>, it will be true for all choices of three elements from <m>H</m>, since <m>H</m> is a subset of <m>G</m>. 
</p></proof></theorem>
 
<p>For every group with at least two elements, there are at least two subgroups: they are the whole group and \(\{e\}\). Since these two are automatic, they are not considered very interesting and are called the improper subgroups of the group; \(\{e\}\) is sometimes referred to as the trivial subgroup. All other subgroups, if there are any, are called proper subgroups.</p>

<p>We can apply <xref ref="th-subgroup-conditions" autoname="yes" /> at both the concrete and axiomatic levels.</p>

<example xml:id="ex-subgroup-proofs"><title>Applying Conditions for a Subgroup</title>
<p><ol label="a">
<li><p>  (Concrete) We can verify that \(2\mathbb{Z} \leq  \mathbb{Z}\), as stated in <xref ref="ex-subsystems" autoname="yes" />. Whenever you want to discuss a subset, you must
find some convenient way of describing its elements. An element of \(2\mathbb{Z}\) can be described as 2 times an integer; that is, \(a \in  2\mathbb{Z}\)
is equivalent to \((\exists k)_{\mathbb{Z}}(a = 2k)\). Now we can verify that the three conditions of <xref ref="th-subgroup-conditions" autoname="yes" /> are true for 2<m>\mathbb{Z}</m>.
 First, if \(a, b \in  2\mathbb{Z}\), then there exist \(j, k \in  \mathbb{Z}\) such that \(a = 2j\) and \(b = 2k\).   A common error is to write
something like  \(a=2j\)  and \(b=2j\).  This would mean that \(a=b\), which is not necessarily true.   That is why two different variables
are needed to describe \(a\) and <m>b</m>.  Returning to our proof, we can add <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>: \(a + b = 2j + 2k = 2(j + k)\). 

Since \(j + k\) is an integer, \(a + b\) is an element of \(2\mathbb{Z}\).   Second, the identity, \(0\), belongs to 2<m>\mathbb{Z}</m> (\(0 = 2(0)\)).  Finally, if \(a \in  2\mathbb{Z}\) and \(a = 2k, -a = -(2k) = 2(-k)\), and  \(-k\in \mathbb{Z}\),  therefore, \(-a \in  2\mathbb{Z}\). By <xref ref="th-subgroup-conditions" autoname="yes" />, \(2\mathbb{Z} \leq  \mathbb{Z}\).
How would this argument change if you were asked to prove that \(3\mathbb{Z} \leq  \mathbb{Z}\)? or \(n \mathbb{Z} \leq  \mathbb{Z}, n \geq  2\)?</p></li>
<li><p>  (Concrete) We can prove that \(H = \{0, 3, 6, 9\}\) is a subgroup of \(\mathbb{Z}_{12}\). First, for each ordered pair \((a, b) \in  H \times
 H\), \(a +_{12} b\) is in <m>H</m>. This can be checked without too much trouble since \(\left| H \times H\right| = 16\). Thus we can conclude
that <m>H</m> is closed under \(+_{12}\). Second, \(0\in H\). Third, \(-0 = 0\), \(-3 = 9\), \(-6 = 6\), and \(-9 = 3\). Therefore, the inverse of each element of \(H\) is in <m>H</m>.</p></li>
<li><p> (Axiomatic) If <m>H</m> and <m>K</m> are both subgroups of a group <m>G</m>, then \(H \cap  K\) is a subgroup of <m>G</m>. To justify this statement, we have no concrete information to work with, only the facts that \(H \leq  G\) and \(K \leq G\). Our proof that \(H \cap  K \leq  G\) reflects
this and is an exercise in applying the definitions of intersection and subgroup, (i) If \(a\) and \(b\) are elements of \(H \cap K\), then \(a\) and \(b\) both belong to <m>H</m>, and since \(H \leq  G\), \(a * b\) must be an element of <m>H</m>. Similarly, \(a * b \in  K\); therefore, \(a * b \in  H \cap  K\). (ii)
The identity of <m>G</m> must belong to both <m>H</m> and <m>K</m>; hence it belongs to \(H \cap  K\). (iii) If \(a \in H \cap K\), then \(a \in 
H\), and since \(H \leq  G\), \(a^{-1}\in  H\).  Similarly, \(a^{-1}\in K\). Hence, by the theorem,  \(H \cap  K \leq  G\).

Now that this fact has been established, we can apply it to any pair of subgroups of any group. For example, since \(2\mathbb{Z}\) and \(3\mathbb{Z}\)
are both subgroups of \([\mathbb{Z};+]\), \(2\mathbb{Z} \cap  3\mathbb{Z}\) is also a subgroup of <m>\mathbb{Z}</m>. Note that if \(a \in 2\mathbb{Z}
\cap  3\mathbb{Z}\),  \(a\) must have a factor of 3; that is, there exists \(k\in \mathbb{Z}\) such that \(a = 3k\). In addition, <m>a</m> must
be even, therefore <m>k</m> must be even. There exists \(j \in  \mathbb{Z}\) such that \(k = 2j\), therefore \(a = 3(2j)= 6j\).  This shows
that \(2\mathbb{Z}\cap  3\mathbb{Z}\subseteq  6\mathbb{Z}\). The opposite containment can easily be established; therefore, \(2\mathbb{Z} \cap  3\mathbb{Z}
= 6\mathbb{Z}\).

</ol></p>
</example>
<p>Given a finite group, we can apply <xref ref="theorem-11-3-finite" autoname="yes" /> to obtain a simpler condition for a subset to be a subgroup.</p>

<theorem xml:id="th-subgroup-of-finite-group">
<title>Condition for a Subgroup of Finite Group</title>
<statement><p>Given that \([G; * ]\) is a finite group and <m>H</m> is a nonempty subset of <m>G</m>, if <m>H</m> is closed under \(*\) , then <m>H</m> is a subgroup of <m>G</m>.</p></statement>
<proof><p>In this proof, we demonstrate that Conditions (b) and (c) of <xref ref="th-subgroup-conditions" autoname="yes" /> follow from the closure of <m>H</m> under \(*\), which is condition (a) of the theorem.  First, select any element of <m>H</m>; call it \(\beta\). The powers of \(\beta\) : \(\beta ^1\), \(\beta ^2\), \(\beta^3,\ldots\) are all in \(H\) by the closure property. By <xref ref="theorem-11-3-finite" autoname="yes" />, there exists <m>m</m>, \(m\leq \left| G\right|\), such that \(\beta ^m = e\);
hence \(e \in  H\). To prove that (c) is true, we let <m>a</m> be any element of \(H\). If \(a = e\), then \(a^{-1}\) is in <m>H</m> since \(e^{-1} = e\). If \(a\neq e\), \(a^q=e\) for some <m>q</m> between 2 and \(\left| G\right|\) and
\[e = a^q = a ^{q-1} * a\]

Therefore, \(a^{-1}= a^{q-1}\) , which belongs to <m>H</m> since \(q - 1 \geq  1\).</p></proof></theorem>

<example xml:id="ex-subgroup-finite">
<title>Applying the condition for a subgroup of a finite group</title>
<p>To determine whether \(H_1= \{0, 5, 10\}\) and \(H_2 = \{0, 4, 8, 12\}\) are subgroups of \(\mathbb{Z}_{15}\), we need only write
out the addition tables (modulo 15) for these sets.  This is easy to do with a bit of Sage code that we include below and then for any modulus and subset, we can generate the body of an addition table.   The code is set up for <m>H_1</m> but can be easily adjusted for <m>H_2</m>.</p>
<sage>
<input>
def addition_table(n,H):
    for a in H:
        line=[]
        for b in H:
            line+=[(a+b)%n]
        print line
addition_table(15,Set([0,5,10]))
</input>
<output>
[0, 10, 5]
[10, 5, 0]
[5, 0, 10]
</output>
</sage>
<p>Note that \(H_1\) is a subgroup of \(\mathbb{Z}_{15}\). Since the interior of the addition table for \(H_2\) contains elements that are outside of
\(H_2\), \(H_2\) is not a subgroup of \(\mathbb{Z}_{15}\).</p>
</example>



<p>One kind of subgroup that merits special mention due to its simplicity is the cyclic subgroup.</p>

<definition xml:id="def-cyclic-subgroup"><title>Cyclic Subgroup</title>
<index><main>Cyclic Subgroup</main></index>
<notation><usage>\langle a \rangle)</usage><description>the cyclic subgroup generated by <m>a</m></description></notation>
<statement><p> If <m>G</m> is a group and \(a \in  G\), the cyclic subgroup generated by <m>a</m>, \(\langle a \rangle\), is the
set of all powers of <m>a</m>:
\[\langle a \rangle = \left\{a^n: n \in  \mathbb{Z}\right\}\]
</p>
<p>A subgroup <m>H</m> of a group <m>G</m> is cyclic if there exists \(a \in  H\) such that \(H = \langle a \rangle\).</p>
</statement></definition>

<definition xml:id="def-cyclic-group"><title>Cyclic Group</title>
<index><main>Cyclic Group</main></index>
<statement><p>A group <m>G</m>  is cyclic if there exists \(\beta \in G\) such that \(\langle \beta \rangle=G\).</p></statement></definition>

<note><p>If the operation on <m>G</m> is additive, then \(\langle a \rangle = \{(n)a : n \in  \mathbb{Z}\}\). </p></note>

<example xml:id="ex-11-5-4"><p><ol label="a">
<li><p> In \([\mathbb{R} ; \cdot ]\),  \(\langle 2 \rangle = \left\{2^n : n \in  \mathbb{Z}\right\} = \left\{\ldots ,\frac{1}{16}, \frac{1}{8} ,\frac{1}{4}, \frac{1}{2},
1, 2, 4, 8, 16,\ldots \right\}\).</p></li>
<li><p> In \(\mathbb{Z}_{15}\), \(\langle 6 \rangle = \{0, 3, 6, 9, 12\}\).   If <m>G</m> is finite, you need list only the positive powers (or multiples) of <m>a</m> up
to the first occurrence of the identity to obtain all of <m>\langle a \rangle</m>. In \(\mathbb{Z}_{15}\) , the multiples of 6 are 6, \((2)6 = 12\), \((3)6=3\),
\((4)6=9\), and \((5)6 = 0\). Note that \(\{0, 3, 6, 9, 12\}\) is also \(\langle 3 \rangle\),\(\langle 9 \rangle\), and \(\langle 12 \rangle\). This shows that a cyclic subgroup can have
different generators.</p></li>
