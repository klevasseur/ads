<title>Recurrence Relations</title>
<introduction>
<p>In this section we will begin our study of recurrence relations and their solutions. Our primary focus will be on the class of finite order linear recurrence relations with constant coefficients (shortened to finite order linear relations). First, we will examine closed form
expressions from which these relations arise. Second, we will present an algorithm for solving them. In later sections we will consider some other
common relations (8.4) and introduce two additional tools for studying recurrence relations: generating functions (8.5) and matrix methods (Chapter
12).</p>

<definition xml:id="def-recurrence-relation"><title>Recurrence Relation</title><idx>Recurrence Relation</idx><statement><p>Let <m>S</m> be a sequence of numbers.  A recurrence relation on <m>S</m> is a formula that relates all but a finite number of terms of <m>S</m> to previous terms of <m>S</m>. That is, there is a <m>k_0</m> in the domain of <m>S</m> such that if <m>k \geq  k_0</m>, then <m>S(k)</m>
is expressed in terms of some (and possibly all) of the terms that precede <m>S(k)</m>. If the domain of <m>S</m> is <m>\{0,1,2,\dots \}</m>, the terms <m>S
(0), S(1), . . . , S\left(k_0-1\right)</m> are not defined by the recurrence formula. Their values are the initial conditions (or boundary conditions, or basis) that complete the definition of <m>S</m>.</p></statement></definition>

<example xml:id="ex-some-recurrence-relations"><title>Some Examples of Recurrence Relations</title><p><ol marker="(a)">
<li><p> The Fibonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence relation <m>F_k= F_{k-2}+ F_{k-1}</m>, <m>k\geq 2,</m> with the initial conditions <m>F_0=1</m> and <m>F_1=1</m>. The recurrence relation is called a second-order relation because <m>F_k</m> depends on the two previous terms of
<m>F</m>. Recall that the sequence <m>C</m> in Section 8.2, <xref ref="ex-three-sequences"/>, can be defined with the same recurrence relation, but with different initial conditions.</p></li>
<li><p> The relation <m>T(k) = 2T(k - 1)^2 - k T(k - 3)</m> is a third-order recurrence relation. If values of <m>T(0)</m>, <m>T(1)</m>, and <m>T(2)</m>
are specified, then <m>T</m> is completely defined.</p></li>
<li><p> The recurrence relation <m>S(n) = S(\lfloor n/2\rfloor ) + 5</m>, <m>n > 0</m>, with <m>S(0)=0</m> has infinite order.

<p>Sequences are often most easily defined with a recurrence relation; however, the calculation of terms by directly applying a recurrence relation
can be time-consuming. The process of determining a closed form expression for the terms of a sequence from its recurrence relation is called solving
the relation. There is no single technique or algorithm that can be used to solve all recurrence relations. In fact, some recurrence relations cannot
be solved. The relation that defines <m>T</m> above is one such example. Most of the recurrence relations that you are likely to encounter in
the future are classified as finite order linear recurrence relations with constant coefficients. This class is the one that we will spend most of
our time with in this chapter.</p>

<definition xml:id="def-n-th-order-rr"><title><m>n^{th}</m> Order Linear Recurrence Relation</title> <idx>Order of a Recurrence Relation</idx><statement><p>Let <m>S</m> be a sequence of numbers with domain <m>k\geq 0</m>. An <m>n^{\textrm{th}}</m>
order linear recurrence relation on <m>S</m> with constant coefficients is a recurrence relation that can be written in the form
<me>S(k) + C_1 S(k - 1) + . . . + C_n S(k - n) = f(k)\textrm{  for  }k \geq  n</me>
where <m>C_1, C_2, \ldots , C_n</m> are constants and <m>f</m> is a numeric function that is defined for <m>k \geq n</m>.</p></statement></definition>

<p>Note: We will shorten the name of this class of relations to <m>n^{\textrm{th}}</m> order linear relations. Therefore, in further discussions, <m>S(k)
+ 2k S(k - 1) = 0</m> would not be considered a first-order linear relation.</p>

<p>Before giving an algorithm for solving finite order linear relations, we will examine recurrence relations that arise from certain closed form
expressions. The closed form expressions are selected so that we will obtain finite order linear relations from them. This approach
may seem a bit contrived, but if you were to write down a few simple algebraic expressions, chances are that most of them would be similar to the
ones we are about to examine.</p>

<p>For our first example, consider <m>D</m>, defined by <m>D(k) =5\cdot 2^k</m>, <m>k \geq  0</m>. If <m>k \geq  1</m>,

<m>\quad</m><m>D(k) =5\cdot 2^k = 2\cdot 5\cdot 2^{k-1} = 2 D(k - 1)</m>.

Therefore, <m>D</m> satisfies the first order linear relation <m>D(k) - 2 D(k - 1) = 0</m> and the initial condition <m>D(0) = 5</m> serves as an initial
condition for <m>D</m>.</p>
<p>As a second example, consider <m>C(k) =3^{k-1}+2^{k+1}+k</m> , <m>k \geq  0</m>. Quite a bit more algebraic manipulation is required to get our result:</p>

<p>The recurrence relation that we have just obtained, defined for <m>k \geq  2</m>, together with the initial conditions <m>C(0) = 7/3</m> and <m>C(1) = 6</m>,
define <m>C</m>.
</p>

<p><xref ref="table-reverse-solutions-rr" text="type-global"/> summarizes our results together with a few other examples that we will let the reader derive. Based on these results, we might conjecture
that any closed form expression for a sequence that combines exponential expressions and polynomial expressions will be solutions of finite order
linear relations. Not only is this true, but the converse is true: a finite order linear relation defines a closed form expression that is similar
to the ones that were just examined. The only additional information that is needed is a set of initial conditions.</p>

</p></statement></definition>


<example xml:id="ex-first-order-homogeneous-rr"><title>First Order Homogeneous Recurrence Relations</title><p><m>D(k) - 2D(k - 1) = 0</m> is a first-order homogeneous relation. Since it can also be written as <m>D(k) = 2D(k - 1)</m>, it should be no surprise that it arose from an expression that involves powers of 2. More generally, you would expect that the solution of <m>L(k) - a L(k - 1)</m> would involve <m>a^k</m>. Actually, the solution is <m>L(k) = L(0)a^k</m>, where the value of <m>L(0)</m> is given by the initial condition.
</p></example>

<example xml:id="ex-second-order-rr"><title>A Second Order Example</title>
<p> Consider the second-order homogeneous relation <m>S(k) - 7S(k - 1) + 12 S(k- 2) = 0</m> together with the initial conditions
<m>S(0) = 4</m> and <m>S(1) = 4</m>. From our discussion above, we can predict that the solution to this relation involves terms of the form <m>b a^k</m>,
where <m>b</m> and <m>a</m> are nonzero constants that must be determined. If the solution were to equal this quantity exactly, then

<me>\quad \quad \quad  \begin{array}{ccc}
 S(k)=b a^k &amp;   &amp;   \\
 S(k-1)=b a^{k-1} &amp; \textrm{   } &amp; \textrm{  } \\
 S(k-2)=b a^{k-2} &amp;   &amp;   \\
\end{array}</me>

Substitute these expressions into the recurrence relation to get


<me> b a^k-7 b a^{k-1}+12 b a^{k-2}=0</me>

Each term on the left-hand side of this equation has a factor of <m>b a^{k-2}</m>, which is nonzero. Dividing through by this common factor yields

<mdn><mrow xml:id="eq-characteristic-example">a^2 - 7a + 12 = (a - 3) (a - 4) = 0</mrow></mdn></p>

<p>Therefore, the only possible values of <m>a</m> are 3 and 4. Equation <xref ref="eq-characteristic-example"/> is called the characteristic equation of the recurrence relation.
The fact is that our original recurrence relation is true for any sequence of the form <m>S(k) = b_1 3^k + b_24^k</m>, where <m>b_1</m> and <m>b_2</m> are
real numbers. This set of sequences is called the general solution of the recurrence relation. If we didn't have initial conditions for <m>S</m>, we would stop here. The initial conditions make it possible for us to find definite values for <m>b_1</m> and <m>b_2</m>.

 <me>\left\{
\begin{array}{c}
 S(0)=4 \\
 S(1)=4 \\
\end{array}
\right\}\textrm{  }\Rightarrow \left\{
\begin{array}{c}
 b_13^0+b_24^0=4 \\
 b_13^1+b_24^1=4 \\
\end{array}
\right\}\textrm{  }\Rightarrow \left\{
\begin{array}{c}
 b_1+b_2=4 \\
 3b_1+4b_2=4 \\
\end{array}
\right\}\textrm{  }</me>
</p>

<p>The solution of this set of simultaneous equations is <m>b_1 = 12</m> and <m>b_2 = -8</m> and so the solution is <m>S(k) = 12 \cdot 3^k - 8 \cdot 4^k</m>.

</algorithm>

<p>Although this algorithm is valid for all values of <m>n</m>, there are limits to the size of <m>n</m> for which the algorithm is feasible. Using just a pencil and paper, we can always solve second-order equations. The quadratic formula for the roots of <m>a x^2 + b x + c = 0</m> is
<me>x=\frac{-b\pm \sqrt{b^2-4 a c}}{2 a}</me>
The solutions of <m>a^2+ C_1a + C_2 = 0</m> are then

</p>

<p>Although cubic and quartic formulas exist, they are too lengthy to introduce here. For this reason, the only higher-order relations (<m>n\geq 3</m>)
that you could be expected to solve by hand are ones for which there is an easy factorization of the characteristic polynomial.</p>

<li><p>Note that we have written the recurrence relation in <q>nonstandard</q> form. To avoid errors in this easy step, you might consider a rearrangement

<p>Here is one rule that might come in handy: If the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial are all integers, with the constant
term equal to <m>m</m>, then the only possible rational characteristic roots are divisors of <m>m</m> (both positive and negative).</p>

<p>With the aid of a computer (or possibly only a calculator), we can increase <m>n</m>. Approximations of the characteristic roots can be obtained
by any of several well-known methods, some of which are part of standard software packages. There is no general rule that specifies the values of
<m>n</m> for which numerical approximations will be feasible. The accuracy that you get will depend on the relation that you try to solve. (See
Exercise 17 of this section.)</p>

<li><p>Since the right-hand side is a constant, we guess that the particular solution will be a constant, <m>d</m>.</p></li>
<li><p> If we substitute <m>S^{(p)}(k) = d</m> into the recurrence relation, we get <m>d + 5d = 9</m>, or <m>6d = 9</m>. Therefore, <m>S^{(p)}(k)=1.5</m>.</p></li>
<li><p> The general solution of the recurrence relation is

<note><title>A quick note on interest rates</title> <p>When a quantity, such as a savings account balance, is increased by some fixed percent, it is most easily
computed with a multiplier. In the case of an <m>8\%</m> increase, the multiplier is 1.08 because any original amount <m>A</m>, has <m>0.08A</m> added
to it, so that the new balance is <m>A+0.08A = (1+0.08)A = 1.08 A</m>.</p>

<p>Another example is that if the interest rate is <m>3.5\%</m>, the multiplier would be 1.035. This presumes that the interest is applied at the end of year for <m>3.5\%</m> annual interest, often called <term>simple interest</term>. If the interest is applied monthly, and we assume a simplifed case where each month has the same length, the multiplier after every month would be <m>\left(1+\frac{0.035}{12}\right) \approx  1.00292</m>. After a
year passes, this multiplier would be applied 12 times, which is the same as multiplying by <m>1.00292^{12}\approx 1.03557</m>. That increase from
1.035 to 1.03557 is the effect of <term>compound interest</term>.</p>

<example xml:id="ex-a-novel-annuity"><title>A Sort of Annuity</title><p> Suppose you open a savings account that pays an annual interest rate of <m>8\%</m>. In addition, suppose you decide to deposit one dollar when you open the account, and you intend to double your deposit each year.

If, instead of doubling the deposit each year, you deposited
a constant amount, <m>q</m>, the <m>2^k</m> term would be replaced with <m>q</m>.  A sequence of regular deposits such as this is called a simple annuity.</p>

</example>
<p>We conclude this section with a comment on the situation in which the characteristic equation gives rise to complex roots. If we restrict the coefficients
of our finite order linear relations to real numbers, or even to integers, we can still encounter characteristic equations whose roots are complex.
Here, we will simply take the time to point out that our algorithms are still valid with complex characteristic roots, but the customary method for
expressing the solutions of these relations is different. Since an understanding of these representations requires some background in complex numbers,
we will simply suggest that an interested reader can refer to a more advanced treatment of recurrence relations (see also difference equations).</p>
