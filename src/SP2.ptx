<introduction>
<p>
In this section we will concentrate of random processes that will involve one or more identical random experiments with two possible outcomes. The simplest such example would be one or more flips of a coin. Let's jump into the formal definitions and then we'll look at a few examples.</p>

<p>We can think of either possible outcome of a binomial trial as success or failure. The important thing is to have a sample space with exactly two elements.</p>
<p>A fair coin flip is a binomial trial with <m>p=1/2</m>. If we roll a six sided die and interpret success as whether a six is rolled, this is a binomial trial with <m>p=1/6</m>. </p>
<p>A basketball player shooting a free throw, with success being whether they make the free thow, is probably not a binomial trial because the probability of success is not likely to be constant. Factors such as fatigue and game pressure are likely to change the probablity of success. However, we can free throw shooting as a binomial process as long as we understand that it is an approximation of reality.</p>

<p>In reality, each free throw can have some effect on the next free throw. We say that each free throw is not necessarily independent of previous ones. Independence is an important assumption when we define a binomial process. Intuitively, two experiments are independent if the outcome of one does not affect the other. The formal definition that follows and gives a precise condition.</p>

<statement>
<p>A finite <em>binomial process</em> is a sequence of identical independent Bernoulli trials <m><em>X_</em>1</m>, <m><em>X_2</em></m>, <m> <em>X_</em>3</m>, <m>\dots</m>, <m>X_n</m> such that for each <em>i</em>, X_i the probability of success is a constant <m>p</m>. We use the notation <m>B(n,p)</m> for an <m>n</m> step binomial process with probability of success <m>p</m>.
</p>
</statement></definition>

<p>The probability of any number of successes in a finite binomial process is fairly easy to describe. Instead of a general proof, we will derive one specific probability for a <m>B(6,p)</m> and the correctness of the general formula should be clear from our logic. Let's look at the probability of exactly four successes. If we were to record the outcome of six independent trials, writing S for success and F for failure, there as several ways in which we could observe four successes. On such case would be SFFSSS, and another is FSSSFS. The first these two occurred with probability <m>p\cdot (1-p)\cdot (1-p)\cdot p\cdot p\cdot p</m> while the second had probability
<m>(1-p)\cdot p\cdot p\cdot p\cdot (1-p) \cdot p</m>. But both of these products reduce to <m>p^4 \cdot (1-p)^2</m>, as do all of the other ways in which we can have four successes. The number of different orderings of four successes and two failures is <m>\binom{6}{4}</m> - think of how you have to select four positions in the sequence of six to get success. Therefore the probability of having four successes is
<me>\binom{6}{4}p^4 \cdot (1-p)^2</me>.</p>
<p>We can generalize this result to give us a formula for 
<m>k</m> successes in a <m>B(n,p)</m>.</p>

<theorem xml:id="theorem-binomial-process-probabilities"><title>Binomial Process Probabilities</title>
<idx>Binomial Process Probabilities</idx>
<statement>
<p>Given a finite <em>binomial process,</em> <m>B(n,p)</m>, the probability of exactly <m>k</m> successes, <m>0\leq k \leq n</m> is
<me>\binom{n}{k}p^k \cdot (1-p)^{n-k}</me>.
</p>
</statement></theorem>
<p>What follows isn't a proof of the theorem above, but it should make it's correctness even more convincing. We know that in a <m>B(n,p)</m> there must be anywhere from 0 to <m>n</m> successes. So let's add the probabilities we've observed. The numbers of possible successes are mutually exclusive - you can't get more than one of them to occur. So we should get a sum equal to <m>1</m>.
<me> \sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k}p^k \cdot (1-p)^{n-k}= (p + (1-p))^n = 1^n=1</me>
</p>
<example><title>The Distribution of transmission errors</title>
<p>A binary symmetric channel is an approximation of a form of noise that is often observed in a communication channel. As individual bits are transmitted, we assume that there is some fixed, usually very small, probability <m>p</m> that the value of the bit will switch. If <m>N</m> bits are to be transmitted, this is a <m>B(N,p)</m> binomial process. </p>
<p>Suppose that 1024 bits are to be transmitted across a binary symmetric channel with <m>p=0.002</m>. For any single bit, the likelihood of an error is quite small, but we can compute the probability of having any number of errors in the full transmission. If there are to be <m>k</m> errors, then the number positions of those errors among all of the bits is <m>\binom{1024}{k}</m>. The probability of any single error pattern is <m>(0.002)^k \cdot (0.998)^{1024-k}</m>. The product
<me>\binom{1024}{k} (0.002)^k \cdot (0.998)^{1024-k}</me>
is then the probability of exactly <m>k</m> transmission errors.</p>
<p> Here is a plot of these probabilities for <m>k \leq 5</m></p>

<p>Notice that the probability that there is no error among all bits is approximately <m>0.13</m> and it is more likely that there are 1, 2 or 3 errors in the data that is received. </p>
