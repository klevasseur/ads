<idx>Isomorphisms</idx>
<introduction><p>The following informal definition of isomorphic systems should be memorized. No matter how technical a discussion about isomorphic
systems becomes, keep in mind that this is the essence of the concept.</p>

<definition xml:id="def-isomorphism-informal"><title>Isomorphic Systems/Isomorphism - Informal Version</title>
<statement><p>Two algebraic systems are isomorphic if there exists a translation rule between them so that any
true statement in one system can be translated to a true statement in the other.</p></statement></definition> 

<example xml:id="ex-greek-arithmetic"><title>How to Do Greek Arithmetic</title><p>Imagine that you are a six-year-old child who has been reared in an English-speaking family, has moved to Greece, and has been enrolled in a Greek school. Suppose that your new teacher asks the class to do the following addition problem that has been written out in Greek.
  \[\tau \rho \acute{\iota} \alpha \quad \sigma \upsilon \nu \quad  \tau \acute{\epsilon} \sigma \sigma \varepsilon \rho \alpha \quad \iota \sigma o \acute{\upsilon} \tau \alpha \iota \quad \_\_\_\_\]
The natural thing for you to do is to take out your Greek-English/English-Greek dictionary and translate the Greek words to English, as outlined
in <xref ref="fig-greek-sum" text="type-global" /> After you've solved the problem, you can consult the same dictionary to find the proper Greek word that the teacher wants. Although
this is not the recommended method of learning a foreign language, it will surely yield the correct answer to the problem. Mathematically, we may
say that the system of Greek integers with addition (\(\sigma \upsilon \nu\)) is isomorphic to English integers with addition (plus). The problem
of translation between natural languages is more difficult than this though, because two complete natural languages are not isomorphic, or at least
the isomorphism between them is not contained in a simple dictionary.</p>

<example xml:id="ex-set-isomorphism"><title>Software Implementation of Sets</title>
<p>In this example, we will describe how set  variables can be implemented on a computer.
We will describe the two systems first and then describe the isomorphism between them.</p>

<p>System 1: The power set of \(\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}\) with the operation union, \(\cup\). For simplicity, we will only discuss union. However, the other
operations are implemented in a similar way.</p>

<p>System 2: Strings of five bits of computer memory with an OR gate. Individual bit values are either zero or one, so the elements of this system can
be visualized as sequences of five 0's and 1's. An OR gate, <xref ref="fig-set-isomorphism" text="type-global" />, is a small piece of computer hardware that accepts two bit values at any one time and outputs either a zero or one, depending on the inputs. The output of an OR gate is one, except when the two bit values that it accepts are both zero, in which case the output is zero. The operation on this system actually consists of sequentially inputting the values of two bit strings into the OR gate. The result will be a new string of five 0's and 1's. An alternate method of operating in this system is to use five OR gates and to input corresponding pairs of bits from the input strings into the gates concurrently.</p>

				  <description>Translation between sets and strings of bits</description>
			 </image>
</figure>
<p>The Isomorphism: Since each system has only one operation, it is clear that union and the OR gate translate into one another. The translation between
sets and bit strings is easiest to describe by showing how to construct a set from a bit string. If \(a_1a_2a_3a_4a_5\), is a bit string in System
2, the set that it translates to contains the number <m>k</m> if and only if \(a_k\) equals 1. For example, \(10001\) is translated to the set
\(\{1, 5\}\), while the set \(\{1, 2\}\) is translated to \(11000.\) Now imagine that your computer is like the child who knows English and must
do a Greek problem. To execute a program that has code that includes the set expression \(\{1, 2\} \cup  \{1, 5\}\), it will follow the same procedure
as the child to obtain the result, as shown in <xref ref="fig-set-calculation" text="type-global" />.</p>

<example xml:id="ex-log-multiplication"><title>Multiplying without doing multiplication</title>
<p>This isomorphism is between\(\left[\mathbb{R}^+ ; \cdot \right]\) and <m>[\mathbb{R};+]</m>. Until the 1970s, when the price of calculators dropped, multiplication and exponentiation were performed with an isomorphism between these systems. The isomorphism \(\left(\mathbb{R}^+\right.\) to \(\mathbb{R}\)) between the two groups is that \(\cdot\) is translated into \(+\) and any positive real
number <m>a</m> is translated to the logarithm of <m>a</m>. To translate back from <m>\mathbb{R}</m> to \(\mathbb{R}^+\) , you invert the logarithm
function. If base ten logarithms are used, an element of <m>\mathbb{R}</m>, <m>b</m>, will be translated to \(10^b\).  In pre-calculator days, the
translation was done with a table of logarithms or with a slide rule. An example of how the isomorphism is used appears in <xref ref="fig-log-mult" text="type-global" />.</p>

<p>The following definition of an isomorphism between two groups is a more formal one that appears in most abstract algebra texts. At first glance,
it appears different, it is really a slight variation on the informal definition. It is the common definition because it is easy to apply; that is,
given a function, this definition tells you what to do to determine whether that function is an isomorphism.</p>

 <note>
<p><ol label="(a)">
<li><p>  There could be several different isomorphisms between the same pair of groups. Thus, if you are asked to demonstrate that two groups are isomorphic, your answer need not be unique.</p></li>
<li><p>  Any application of this definition requires a procedure outlined in <xref ref="fig-steps-iso" text="type-global" />.
The first condition, that an isomorphism be a bijection, reflects the fact that every true statement in the first group should have exactly one corresponding
true statement in the second group. This is exactly why we run into difficulty in translating between two natural languages. To see how Condition
(b) of the formal definition is consistent with the informal definition, consider the function \(L:\mathbb{R}^+\to  \mathbb{R}\) defined by \(L(x)
= \log _{10}x\). The translation diagram between \(\mathbb{R}^+\) and <m>\mathbb{R}</m> for the multiplication problem \(a \cdot  b\) appears in <xref ref="fig-log-mult-general" text="type-global" />. We arrive at the same result by computing \(L^{-1} (L(a) + L(b))\) as we do by computing \(a \cdot  b\). If we apply the function \(L\) to the two results, we get the same image:
<mdn> 
 <mrow xml:id="eq-iso">L(a \cdot  b) = L\left(L^{-1}(L(a) + L(b))\right) = L(a) + L(b) </mrow>
</mdn>

since \(L\left(L^{-1}(x)\right) = x\). Note that <xref ref="eq-iso" text="local" /> is exactly Condition b of the formal definition applied to the two groups \(\mathbb{R}^+\) and <m>\mathbb{R}</m>.</p></li>

<example xml:id="ex-another-iso-pair">
<p> Consider  \(G= \left\{\left.\left(
\begin{array}{cc}
 1 &amp; a \\
 0 &amp; 1 \\
\end{array}
\right) \right| a \in \mathbb{R}\right\}\) with matrix multiplication.   The group \([\mathbb{R};+]\) is isomorphic to <m>G</m>.   Our translation
rule is the function \(f: \mathbb{R} \to G\) defined by \(f(a)=\left(
\begin{array}{cc}
 1 &amp; a \\
 0 &amp; 1 \\
\end{array}
\right)\).  Since groups have only one operation, there is no need to state explicitly that addition is translated to matrix multiplication. That
<m>f</m> is a bijection is clear from its definition.</p>
<p> If <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are any real numbers,



<me>
\begin{split}
f(a) f(b) &amp; = \left(
\begin{array}{cc}
 1 &amp; a \\
 0 &amp; 1 \\
\end{array}
\right)\left(
\begin{array}{cc}
 1 &amp; b \\
 0 &amp; 1 \\

&amp; = \left(

 1 &amp; a + b \\
 0 &amp; 1 \\
\end{array}
\right)\\
&amp; = f(a + b)
\end{split}
</me>

</p>

<p>We can apply this translation rule to determine the inverse of a matrix in \(G\). We know that \(a + (-a)=0\) is a true statement in <m>\mathbb{R}</m>. Using
<m>f</m> to translate this statement, we get



\[f(a) f(-a) = f(0)\]
or
\[\left(
\begin{array}{cc}
 1 &amp; a \\
 0 &amp; 1 \\
\end{array}
\right)\left(
\begin{array}{cc}
 1 &amp; -a \\
 0 &amp; 1 \\
\end{array}
\right)=\left(
\begin{array}{cc}
 1 &amp; 0 \\
 0 &amp; 1 \\
\end{array}
\right)\]

therefore,



\[\left(
\begin{array}{cc}
 1 &amp; a \\
 0 &amp; 1 \\
\end{array}
\right)^{-1}= \left(
\begin{array}{cc}
 1 &amp; -a \\
 0 &amp; 1 \\
\end{array}
\right)\]

<p>The next theorem summarizes some of the general facts about group isomorphisms that are used most often in applications.  We leave the proof to the reader.</p>

<theorem xml:id="theorem-isomorphism-properties"><title>Properties of Isomorphisms</title>
<statement><p>If \([G;*]\) and \([H;\diamond ]\) are groups with identities <m>e</m> and \(e'\), respectively, and \(T:G \to H\) is an isomorphism from <m>G</m> into <m>H</m>, then:

</ol></p>
</statement></theorem>  


<p><q>Is isomorphic to</q> is an equivalence relation on the set of all groups. Therefore, the set of all groups is partitioned into equivalence classes, each equivalence class containing groups that are isomorphic to one another.</p>

</subsection>

<subsection xml:id="ss-when-are-groups-not-isomorphic"><title>Conditions for groups to not be isomorphic</title>

<p>How do you decide that two groups are not isomorphic to one another? The negation of <q><m>G</m> and <m>H</m> are isomorphic</q> is that no translation rule between <m>G</m> and <m>H</m> exists. If <m>G</m> and <m>H</m> have different cardinalities, then no bijection from <m>G</m> into <m>H</m> can exist. Hence they are not isomorphic. Given that \(\left| G\right| =\left| H\right|\), it is usually impractical to list all bijections from <m>G</m> into <m>H</m> and show that none of them satisfy Condition b of the formal definition. The best way to prove that two groups are not isomorphic is to find a true statement about one group that is not true about the other group. We illustrate this method
in the following checklist that you can apply to most pairs of non-isomorphic groups in this book.</p>

<p>Assume that \([G;*]\) and \([H;\diamond ]\) are groups. The following are reasons for <m>G</m> and <m>H</m> to be not isomorphic.
<ol label="(a)">
<li><p>  <m>G</m> and <m>H</m> do not have the same cardinality. For example, \(\mathbb{Z}_{12} \times  \mathbb{Z}_5\) can't be isomorphic to \(\mathbb{Z}_{50}\) and \([\mathbb{R};+]\) can't be isomorphic to \(\left[\mathbb{Q}^+ ; \cdot \right]\).</p></li>
<li><p> <m>G</m> is abelian and <m>H</m> is not abelian since \(a * b = b * a\) is always true in \(G\), but \(T(a) \diamond  T(b) = T(b) \diamond T(a)\) would not always be true. We have seen  two groups with six elements that apply here.  They are \(\mathbb{Z}_6\) and the group of \(3 \times  3\) rook matrices (see <xref ref="ex-rook-matrices" text="type-global" />). The second group is non-abelian, therefore it can't be isomorphic to \(\mathbb{Z}_6\).</p></li>
<li><p>  <m>G</m> has a certain kind of subgroup that <m>H</m> doesn't have. Part (c) of <xref ref="theorem-isomorphism-properties" text="type-global" /> states that this cannot happen if <m>G</m>
is isomorphic to <m>H</m>. \(\left[\mathbb{R}^* ; \cdot \right]\) and \(\left[\mathbb{R}^+ ; \cdot \right]\) are not isomorphic since \(\mathbb{R}^*\) has a subgroup with two elements, \(\{-1, 1\}\), while the proper subgroups of \(\mathbb{R}^+\) are all infinite (convince yourself of this fact!).</p></li>
<li><p>The number of solutions of \(x * x = e\) in <m>G</m> is not equal to the number of solutions of \(y \diamond  y = e'\) in <m>H</m>.
  \(\mathbb{Z}_8\) is not isomorphic to \(\mathbb{Z}_2{}^3\) since \(x +_8 x = 0\) has two solutions, 0 and 4, while \(y + y = (0, 0, 0)\) is true for all \(y\in \mathbb{Z}_2{}^3\). If the operation in <m>G</m> is defined by a table, then the number of solutions of \(x * x = e\) will be the
number of occurrences of <m>e</m> in the main diagonal of the table. The equations \(x^3 = e\), \(x^4= e, \dots\)  can also be used in the same way to identify pairs of non-isomorphic groups.</p></li>
<li><p>  One of the cyclic subgroups of <m>G</m> equals <m>G</m> (i. e., <m>G</m> is cyclic), while none of <m>H</m>'s cyclic subgroups equals <m>H</m> (i. e., \(H\) is noncyclic). This is a special case of Condition c. <m>\mathbb{Z}</m> and \(\mathbb{Z} \times  \mathbb{Z}\) are not isomorphic
since \(\mathbb{Z} = \langle 1\rangle\) and \(\mathbb{Z} \times  \mathbb{Z}\) is not cyclic.</p></li>
