<introduction>
<p>Now that we have a good understanding of what a function is, our next step is to consider an important operation on functions. Our purpose is not
to develop the algebra of functions as completely as we did for the algebras of logic, matrices, and sets, but the reader should be aware of the
similarities between the algebra of functions and that of matrices. We first define equality of functions.</p>
</introduction>
<subsection xml:id="ss-function-equality"><title>Function Equality</title>

<definition xml:id="def-equality-of-functions"><title>Equality of Functions</title><index><main>Function</main><sub>Equality</sub></index>
<statement><p> Let \(f, g:A \rightarrow  B\); that is, let \(f\) and \(g\) both be functions from \(A\) into \(B\).  Then \(f\) is
equal to \(g\) (denoted \(f=g\)) if and only if \(f(x) = g(x)\) for all \(x \in  A\).</p></statement></definition>


<p>Two functions that have different domains cannot be equal. For example,  \(f: \mathbb{Z}\to \mathbb{Z}\) defined by \(f(x)=x^2\) and \(g: \mathbb{R}\to
\mathbb{R}\) defined by \(g(x)=x^2\) are not equal even though the formula that defines them is the same.</p>

<p>On the other hand, it is not uncommon for two functions to be equal even though they are defined differently. For example consider the functions
<m>h</m> and <m> k</m>, where \(h: \{-1,0,1,2\}\to \{0,1,2\}\) is defined by \(h(x)=|x|\) and \(k: \{-1,0,1,2\}\to \{0,1,2\}\)
is defined by \(k(x) = -\frac{x^3}{3}+x^2+\frac{x}{3}\) appear to be very different functions. However, they are equal because \(h(x)= k(x)\)
for \(x = -1, 0, 1, \text{ and } 2\).</p>
</subsection>
<subsection xml:id="ss-composition"><title>Function Composition</title>


<p>One of the most important operations on functions is that of composition.</p>

<definition xml:id="def-composition-of-functions"><title>Composition of Functions.</title>
<index><main>Composition of Functions</main></index>
<index><main>Function</main><sub>Composition</sub></index>
<notation><usage>(g \circ f)(x) = g(f(x))</usage><description>The composition of <m>g</m> with <m>f</m></description></notation>
<statement><p>Let \(f:A \rightarrow  B\) and \(g:B \rightarrow  C\). Then the composition of <m>f</m> followed by <m>g</m>, written \(g\circ f\), is a function from <m>A</m> into <m>C</m> defined by \((g \circ f)(x) = g(f(x))\), which is read <q><m>g</m> of <m>f</m> of <m>x</m>.</q></p></statement>
</definition> 


<p>The reader should note that it is traditional to write the composition of functions from right to left. Thus, in the above definition, the first function performed in computing \(g \circ f\)  is <m>f</m>. On the other hand, for relations, the composition \(r s\) is read from left
to right, so that the first relation is <m>r</m>.</p>

<example xml:id="ex-simple-composition"><title>A basic example</title><p>Let \(f:\{1, 2, 3\}\rightarrow  \{a, b\}\) be defined by \(f(1) = a\), \(f(2) = a\), and \(f(3) = b\). Let \(g:\{a, b\} \rightarrow  \{5, 6, 7\}\) be defined by \(g(a) = 5\) and \(g(b) = 7\). Then \(g\circ f: \{1, 2, 3\}\rightarrow  \{5, 6, 7\}\) is defined by \((g\circ f)(1)= 5\),
\((g\circ f)(2)= 5,\) and \((g\circ f)(3)= 7\). For example, \((g\circ f)(1)= g(f(l)) = g(a) = 5\). Note that <m>f\circ g</m> is not defined. Why?</p>
<p> Let \(f:\mathbb{R} \rightarrow  \mathbb{R}\) be defined by \(f(x) = x^3\) and let \(g:\mathbb{R} \rightarrow  \mathbb{R}\) be defined by \(g(x)
= 3x+1\). Then, since
 \[(g\circ f)(x) = g(f(x)) = g\left(x^3\right) = 3x^3 + 1\] 
we have \(g\circ f: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow  \mathbb{R}\) is defined by \((g\circ f)(x)= 3x^3 + 1\). Here \(f\circ g\) is also defined and \(f\circ
g:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow \mathbb{R}\) is defined by \((f\circ g)(x)=(3x + 1)^3\) . Moreover, since \(3x ^3+ 1 \neq (3x + 1)^3\) for at least
one real number, \(g\circ f \neq  f\circ g\).  Therefore, the commutative law is not true for functions under the operation of composition.
However, the associative law is true for functions under the operation of composition.
</p></example> 

<theorem xml:id="function-composition-associative">
<title>Function composition is associative</title>
<statement><p>If \(f:A\rightarrow B\),\(g:B\to C\), and \(h:C\rightarrow D\), then \(h\circ (g\circ f) = (h\circ g)\circ f\).</p></statement>
<proof><p>Note: In order to prove that two functions are equal, we must use the definition of equality of functions. Assuming that the functions
have the same domain, they are equal if, for each domain element, the images of that element under the two functions are equal.</p>
<p>We wish to prove that \((h\circ (g\circ f))(x) = ((h\circ g)\circ f)(x)\) for all \(x \in  A\), which is the domain of both functions.
<me>
\begin{split}
(h\circ (g\circ f))(x) &amp;= h((g\circ f) (x))\textrm{   by the definition of composition}\\
			&amp;=h(g(f(x)))\textrm{   by the definition of composition}
\end{split}
</me>
Similarly,
<me>
\begin{split}
((h\circ g)\circ f)(x) &amp;= (h\circ g)(f(x))\textrm{    by the definition of composition}\\
		&amp; =h(g(f(x)))\textrm{     by the definition of composition}
\end{split}
</me>.</p>
<p>Notice that no matter how the functions the expression \(h\circ g\circ f\) is grouped, the final image of any element of \(x\in A\) is \(h(g(f(x)))\) and so \(h\circ (g\circ f) = (h\circ g)\circ f\).</p></proof></theorem> 

<p>If <m>f</m> is a function on a set <m>A</m>, then the compositions \(f\circ  f\), \(f\circ  f\circ  f, \dots \) are valid, and we denote them as
\(f^2\) , \(f^3, \dots \). These repeated composition of <m>f</m> with itself can be defined recursively:</p>

</ul></p>
</statement></definition>

<p>Two useful theorems concerning composition are given below. The proofs are left for the exercises.</p>

<theorem xml:id="theorem-composition-of-injections"><title>The composition of injections is an injection</title><statement><p>If \(f: A \rightarrow  B\) and \(g : B \rightarrow  C\) are injections, then \(g\circ f : A \rightarrow  C\) is an injection.</p></statement></theorem>

</theorem>


<p>We would now like to define the concepts of identity and inverse for functions under composition. The motivation and descriptions of the definitions
of these terms come from the definitions of the terms in the set of real numbers and for matrices. For real numbers, the numbers 0 and 1 play the
unique role that \(x + 0 = 0 + x = x\) and \(x \cdot 1 = 1 \cdot  x = x\) for any real number <m>x</m>.  0 and 1 are the identity elements
for the reals under the operations of addition and multiplication, respectively. Similarly, the \(n \times  n\) zero matrix 0 and the \(n \times
 n\) identity matrix <m>I</m> are such that for any \(n \times  n\) matrix <m>A</m>, \(A + 0 = 0 + A=A\) and \(A I = I A = I\). Hence, an
elegant way of defining the identity function under the operation of composition would be to imitate the above well-known facts.</p>

<notation><usage>i \textrm{ or } i_A</usage><description>The identitiy function (on a set <m>A</m>)</description></notation>
<statement><p>For any set \(A\), the identity function on \(A\) is a function from \(A\) onto \(A\), denoted by \(i\) (or, more specifically, \(i_A\)) such that \(i(a) = a\)  for all \(a\in A\).</p></statement>
</definition>


<p>Based on the definition of <m>i</m>, we can show that for all functions \(f:A\to A\), \(f\circ i=i\circ f = f\).</p>

</subsection>
<subsection xml:id="ss-inverse-functions"><title>Inverse Functions</title>

<p>We will introduce the inverse of a function with a special case: the inverse of a function on a set. After you've taken the time to understand this
concept, you can read about the inverse of a function from one set into another. The reader is encouraged to reread the definition of the inverse
of a matrix in Section 5.2 (<xref ref="def-matrix-inverse" />) to see that the following definition of the inverse function is a direct analogue of that definition.</p>

<definition xml:id="def-inverse-function"><title>Inverse of a Function on a Set</title>
<index><main>Inverse Function</main><sub>of a function on a set</sub></index>
<notation><usage>f^{-1}</usage><description>The inverse of function <m>f</m> read <q><m>f</m> inverse</q></description></notation>
<statement><p> Let \(f: A\rightarrow  A\). If there exists a function \(g : A \rightarrow  A\) such that \(g\circ f = f\circ g = i\), then \(g\) is called the inverse of \(f\) and is denoted by \(f^{-1}\) , read <q><m>f</m> inverse.</q></p></statement>
</definition>


<p>Notice that in the definition we refer to <q>the inverse</q> as opposed to <q>an inverse.</q>  It can be proven that a function can never have
more than one inverse (see exercises).</p>

<p>An alternate description of the inverse of a function, which can be proven from the definition, is as follows:  Let \(f: A \rightarrow  A\) be such that \(f(a) = b\). Then when it exists, \(f^{-1}\) is a function from <m>A</m> to <m>A</m> such that \(f^{-1}(b)=a\).
Note that \(f^{-1}\) <q>undoes</q> what <m>f</m> does. </p>

<example xml:id="ex-simple-inverse"><title>The inverse of a function on \(\{1,2,3\}\)</title><p>Let \(A = \{1, 2, 3\}\) and let <m>f</m> be the function defined on <m>A</m> such that \(f(1) = 2\), \(f(2) = 3\), and
\(f(3) = 1\). Then \(f^{-1} : A \rightarrow  A\) is defined by \(f^{-1}(1) = 3\), \(f^{-1}(2) = 1\), and \(f^{-1}(3) = 2\).</p></example>

<example xml:id="ex-inverse-of-a-real-function"><title>Inverse of a real function</title><p>If \(g : \mathbb{R} \rightarrow  \mathbb{R}\) is defined by \(g(x) =x^3\) , then \(g^{-1}\) is the function that undoes what
<m>g</m> does. Since <m>g</m> cubes real numbers, \(g^{-1}\) must be the <q>reverse</q> process, namely, takes cube roots. Therefore, \(g^{-1}
: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow  \mathbb{R}\) is defined by \(g^{-1}(x)=\sqrt[3]{x}\). We should show that \(g^{-1}\circ g = i\) and \(g\circ g^{-1}=i\).
We will do the first, and the reader is encouraged to do the second.
<me>
\begin{split}
\left(g^{-1}\circ g\right)(x) &amp;= g^{-1}(g(x)) \quad \textrm{ Definition of composition}\\
			&amp;= g^{-1}\left(x^3\right)\quad \text{Definition of } g\\	
			&amp;=\sqrt[3]{x^3}\quad\textrm{Definition of } g^{-1}\\
			&amp; = x\quad\text{Definition of cube root}\\
			&amp;= i(x)\quad\text{Definition of the identity function}
\end{split}
</me>
Therefore, \(g^{-1}\circ g = i\). Why?
</p></example> 

<p>The definition of the inverse of a function alludes to the fact that not all functions have inverses. How do we determine when the inverse of a function
exists?</p>

<theorem xml:id="theorem-bijections-have-inverses"><title>Bijections have inverses</title><statement><p>Let \(f: A\rightarrow  A\).  \(f^{-1}\) exists if and only if f is a bijection; i. e. f is one-to-one and onto.</p></statement><proof><p>(<m>\Rightarrow</m>)  In this half of the proof, assume that \(f^{-1}\) exists and we must prove that <m>f</m> is one-to-one and onto.
To do so, it is convenient for us to use the relation notation, where \(f(s)=t\) is equivalent to \((s,t)\in f\). To prove that <m>f</m> is
one-to-one, assume that \(f(a)=f(b) = c\). Alternatively, that means \((a, c)\) and \((b, c)\) are elements of <m>f</m> . We must show
that \(a =b\). Since \((a, b), (c, b) \in \text{  }f\), \((c, a)\) and \((c,b)\) are in \(f^{-1}\). By the fact that \(f^{-1}\) is a function and <m>c</m> cannot have two images, <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> must be equal, so <m>f</m> is one-to-one. </p>
<p>Next, to prove that <m>f</m> is onto, observe that for \(f^{-1}\) to be a function, it must use all of its domain, namely A. Let <m>b</m>
be any element of <m>A</m>. Then b has an image under \(f^{-1}\) , \(f^{-1}(b)\). Another way of writing this is \(\left(b,f^{-1}(b)\right)\in
f^{-1}\), By the definition of the inverse, this is equivalent to \(\left(f^{-1}(b), b\right) \in  f\). Hence, <m>b</m> is in the range of <m>f</m>. Since <m>b</m> was chosen arbitrarily, this shows that the range of <m> f </m> must be all of <m>A</m>.</p>

<p>(<m>\Leftarrow</m> ) Assume <m>f</m> is one-to-one and onto and we are to prove \(f^{-1}\) exists. We leave this half of the proof to the reader.
<m>\square</m></p></proof></theorem>

</definition>

<p>Next, we will consider the functions for which the domain and codomain are not necessarily equal. How do we define the inverse in this case?</p>

<definition xml:id="def-general-inverse-function"><title>Inverse of a Function (General Case)</title><statement><p>Let \(f:A \rightarrow  B\), If there exists a function \(g:B \rightarrow  A\) such that \(g \circ f = i_A\) and \(f\circ  g = i_B\) , then \(g\) is called the inverse of \(f\) and is denoted by \(f^{-1}\) , read <q>\(f\) inverse.</q></p></statement>
</definition>


<p>Note the slightly more complicated condition for the inverse in this case because the domains of \(f\circ  g\) and \(g \circ f\) are different if <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are different. The proof of the following theorem isn't really very different from the special case where \(A=B\).</p>

<theorem xml:id="theorem-inverse-function-condition"><title>When does a function have an inverse?</title><statement><p> Let \(f:A \rightarrow  B\). \(f^{-1}\) exists if and only if f is a bijection.</p></statement></theorem>

<example xml:id="example-inverse-another"><title>Another inverse</title><p>Let \(A =\{1,2, 3\}\) and \(B = \{a, b, c\}\). Define \(f:A \rightarrow  B\) by \(f(1) = a\), \(f(2) = b\), and {
}\(f(3) = c\). Then \(g: B \rightarrow  A\) defined by \(g(a) = 1\), \(g(b) = 2\), and \(g(c) = 3\) is the inverse of <m>f</m>.

\[\left.
\begin{array}{c}

 \(n\geq 1\), is \(n\)!. Furthermore, assume that \(|A|=\)\(\text{  }n+1\) and that \(A\) contains
  an element called \(\sigma\). Let \(A'=A-\{\sigma\}\). We can reduce the definition of a permutation, \(f\),
   on \(A\) to two steps. First, we select any one of the \(n\)! permutations on \(A'\).
    (Note the use of the induction hypothesis.) Call it \(g\). This permutation almost
     completely defines a permutation on \(A\) that we will call  \(f\).  For all
      \(a\) in \(A'\), we start by defining \(f(a)\) to be \(g(a)\). We may be making some adjustments, but define it that way for now. Next, we select the image of \(\sigma\), which can be done \(n+1\) different ways, allowing for any value in \(A\). To keep our function bijective, we must adjust \(f\) as follows: If we select \(f(\sigma)=y \neq \sigma\), then we must find the element, \(z\), of \(A\) such that \(g(z)=y\), and redefine the image  of \(z\) to \(f(z)=\sigma\). If we had selected \(f(\sigma)=\sigma\), then there is  no adjustment needed. By the rule of products, the number of ways that we can define \(f\) is \(n!(n+1)=(n+1)!\) <m>\square</m></p>

<exercise number="11"><statement><p>State and prove a theorem on inverse functions analogous to the one that says that if a matrix has an inverse, that inverse is unique.</p>
</statement>
<answer>
<p>If \(f:A\to B\) and \(f\) has an inverse, then that inverse is unique.</p>
<p>Proof:  Suppose that \(g\) and \(h\) are both inverses of \(f\).

\[
\begin{split}g &amp;= g\circ i_A \\
		&amp; =g\circ (f\circ h)\\
		&amp; =(g\circ f)\circ h\\
		&amp; =i_A\circ h\\
		&amp; =h\quad \Rightarrow g=h \quad \square
\end{split}

<exercise number="13"><statement><p> Prove <xref ref="theorem-composition-of-injections" autoname="yes"/> and <xref ref="theorem-composition-of-surjections" autoname="yes"/>.</p>
</statement>
<answer> <p> Let \(x,x'\) be elements of \(A\) such that \(g\circ f(x)=g\circ f(x')\); that is, \(g(f(x))=g(f(x'))\). Since \(g\) is injective, \(f(x)=f(x')\) and since \(f\) is injective, \(x=x'\). <m>\square</m></p>
<p> Let \(x\) be an element of \(C\). We must show that there exists an element of \(A\) whose image under \(g\circ f\) is \(x\). Since \(g\) is surjective, there exists an element of \(B\), \(y\), such that \(g(y)=x\). Also, since \(f\) is a surjection, there exists an element of \(A\), \(z\), such that \(f(z)=y\), \(g\circ f(z)=g(f(z))=g(y)=x\).<m>\square</m></p>
