<idx>What Is a Tree? </idx>
<p>What distinguishes trees from other types of graphs is the absence of certain paths called cycles. Recall that a path is a sequence of consecutive edges in a graph, and a circuit is a path that begins and ends at the same vertex.</p>

<definition xml:id="def-cycle"><title>Cycle</title>
<idx>Cycle</idx><notation><usage>C_n</usage><description>A cycle with <m>n</m> edges.</description></notation><statement><p> A cycle is a circuit whose edge list contains no duplicates.  It is customary to use <m>C_n</m> to denote a cycle with \(n\) edges.</p></statement></definition>


<p>The simplest example of a cycle in an undirected graph is a pair of vertices with two edges connecting them. Since trees are cycle-free, we can rule out all multigraphs from consideration as trees.</p>



<p>Trees can either be undirected or directed graphs. We will concentrate on the undirected variety in this chapter.</p>

<li><p> In a loose sense, a botanical tree is a mathematical tree. There are usually no cycles in the branch structure of a botanical tree.</p></li>
<li><p> The structures of some chemical compounds are modeled by a tree. For example, butane <xref ref="fig-butane" /> consists of four carbon atoms and ten hydrogen atoms, where an edge between two atoms represents a bond between them. A bond is a force that keeps two atoms together. The same set of atoms can be linked together in a different tree structure to give us the compound isobutane <xref ref="fig-isobutane" />. There are some compounds whose graphs are not trees. One example is benzene <xref ref="fig-benzene" />.</p>

<p>One type of graph that is not a tree, but is closely related, is a forest.</p>

<definition xml:id="def-forest"><title>Forest</title>
<idx>Forest.</idx><statement><p> A forest is an undirected graph whose components are all trees.</p></statement></definition>



<example xml:id="ex-a-forest"><title>A forest</title><p>The top half of <xref ref="fig-some-trees" text="type-global" /> can be viewed as a forest of three trees.  Graph (vi) in this figure is also a forest.</p></example> 



<p>We will now examine several conditions that are equivalent to the one that defines a tree. The following theorem will be used as a tool in proving that the conditions are equivalent.</p>

<lemma xml:id="lemma-two-paths">
<statement><p>Let \(G = (V, E)\) be an undirected graph with no self-loops, and let \(v_a, v_b\in V\). If two different simple paths exist
between \(v_a\) and \(v_b\), then there exists a cycle in \(G\).</p></statement>
<proof><p>Let \(p_1= \left(e_1, e_2, \ldots , e_m \right)\) and \(p_2=\left(f_1,f_2,\ldots , f_n\right)\) be two different simple paths from \(v_a\)
to \(v_b\). The first step we will take is to delete from \(p_1\) and \(p_2\) the initial edges that are identical. That is, if \(e_1= f_1\),
\(e_2= f_2, \dots \), \(e_{j}= f_j\), and \(e_{j+1}\neq f_{j+1}\) delete the first <m>j</m> edges of both paths. Once this is done, both paths
start at the same vertex, call it \(v_c\), and both still end at \(v_b\). Now we construct a cycle by starting at \(v_c\) and following what is left of \(p_1\) until we first meet what is left of \(p_2\). If this first meeting occurs at vertex \(v_d\), then the remainder of the cycle is completed by following the portion of the reverse of \(p_2\) that starts at \(v_d\) and ends at \(v_c\).</p> </proof>
</lemma>  

<theorem xml:id="theorem-tree-conditions"><title>Equivalent Conditions for a Graph to be a Tree</title>
<statement><p>Let \(G = (V, E)\) be an undirected graph with no self-loops and \(\lvert V \rvert =n\). The following are all equivalent:</p>
<p><ol label="(1)">
<li><p> <m>G</m> is a tree.</p></li>
<li><p> For each pair of distinct vertices in <m>V</m>, there exists a unique simple path between them.</p></li>
<li><p> <m>G</m> is connected, and if \(e\in E\), then \((V, E-\{e\})\) is disconnected.</p></li>
<li><p> <m>G</m> contains no cycles, but by adding one edge, you create a cycle.</p></li>
<li><p> <m>G</m> is connected and \(\lvert E \rvert =n-1 \).</p></li>
</ol></p>
</statement>
<proof>
<p>Proof Strategy. Most of this theorem can be proven by proving the following chain of implications: \((1) \Rightarrow  (2)\), \((2) \Rightarrow  (3)\), \((3)\Rightarrow (4)\), and \((4) \Rightarrow (1)\). Once these implications have been demonstrated, the transitive closure of \(\Rightarrow\) on \({1, 2, 3, 4}\) establishes the equivalence of the first four conditions. The proof that Statement 5 is equivalent to the first four can be done by induction, which we will leave to the reader.</p>
<p>\((1) \Rightarrow  (2)\) (Indirect). Assume that <m>G</m> is a tree and that there exists a pair of vertices between which there is
either no path or there are at least two distinct paths. Both of these possibilities contradict the premise that <m>G</m> is a tree. If no path
exists, <m>G</m> is disconnected, and if two paths exist, a cycle can be obtained by Theorem 10.1.1.</p>
<p>\((2) \Rightarrow  (3)\). We now use Statement 2 as a premise. Since each pair of vertices in <m>V</m> are connected by exactly one path, \textit{ G} is connected. Now if we select any edge <m>e</m> in <m>E</m>, it connects two vertices, \(v_1\) and \(v_2\). By (2), there is no simple path connecting \(v_1\) to \(v_2\) other than \(e\). Therefore, no path at all can exist between \(v_1\) and \(v_2\) in \((V, E - \{e\})\). Hence \((V, E - \{e\})\) is disconnected.</p>
<p>\((3)\Rightarrow (4)\). Now we will assume that Statement 3 is true. We must show that <m>G</m> has no cycles and that adding an edge to \textit{
G} creates a cycle. We will use an indirect proof for this part. Since (4) is a conjunction, by DeMorgan's Law its negation is a disjunction and
we must consider two cases. First, suppose that <m>G</m> has a cycle. Then the deletion of any edge in the cycle keeps the graph connected, which
contradicts (3). The second case is that the addition of an edge to <m>G</m> does not create a cycle. Then there are two distinct paths between
the vertices that the new edge connects. By <xref ref="lemma-two-paths" text="type-global" />, a cycle can then be created, which is a contradiction.</p>

<p>\((4) \Rightarrow (1)\) Assume that <m>G</m> contains no cycles and that the addition of an edge creates a cycle. All that we need to prove to verify that <m>G</m> is a tree is that <m>G</m> is connected. If it is not connected, then select any two vertices that are not connected.
If we add an edge to connect them, the fact that a cycle is created implies that a second path between the two vertices can be found which is in the original graph, which is a contradiction. </p>

<p>The usual definition of a directed tree is based on whether the associated undirected graph, which is created by <q>erasing</q> its directional arrows, is a tree. In Section 10.3 we will introduce the rooted tree, which is a special type of directed tree.</p>
