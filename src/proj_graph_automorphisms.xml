<title>Graph Automorphisms</title>
<statement>
<p> Given any graph, <m>G</m>, it is trivial,to see that <m>G</m> is isomorphic to itself. The identity  function <m>i: G\rightarrow G</m> satisfies the conditions of an isomorphism. Such a function is called an automorphism of <m>G</m>. For some graphs, there are other functions that are also automorphism. For example, any bijection on the vertices of a  <m>K_n</m> is an automorphism of the <m>K_n</m>.  This is an extreme case. A slightly more interesting example is that of path graph with three vertices.

<p>The function, <m>t</m>, defined by <m>t(1)=3, t(2)=2, \textrm{ and }t(3)=1</m> is an isomophism. We verify by noting that 
<ul>
<li><p><m>\{1,2\}</m> is an edge, and <m>\{t(1),t(2)\}=\{3,2\}</m>  is an edge, and</p></li>
<li><p><m>\{2,3\}</m> is an edge, and <m>\{t(2),t(3)\}=\{2,1\}</m>  is an edge.</p></li>
</ul>
Thus, the this path graph has two automorphisms.</p>
<ol label="(a)">
<li><p>Find all automorphisms of the Y-graph.</p></li>
<li><p>How many automorphisms are there of the wheel graph.</p></li>
<li><p>Find a graph for which the only automorphism is the identity function</p></li>
<li><p>Prove that if two graphs, <m>G_1</m> and <m>G_2</m>, are isomorphic and <m>f</m> is an isomorphism between them, then the set of all isomorphisms between the graphs is <m>\{f\circ t \mid t\in A(G_1)\}</m>, where <m>A(G_1)</m> is the set of all automorphsms of <m>G_1</m>.</p></li>
