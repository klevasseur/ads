<introduction><p>As we saw in Section 3.6, if \(p(n)\) is a proposition over a universe <m>U</m>, its truth set \(T_p\) is equal to a subset of U. In many cases, such as when \(p(n)\) is an equation, we are most concerned with whether \(T_p\) is empty or not. In other cases, we might be interested in whether \(T_p=U\); that is, whether \(p(n)\) is a tautology. Since the conditions \(T_p\neq \emptyset\)  and \(T_p=U\) are so often an issue, we have a special system of notation for them.</p></introduction>

<title>The Negation of Quantified Propositions</title><index><main>Quantifiers</main><sub>Negation</sub></index>
<p>When you negate a quantified proposition, the existential and universal quantifiers complement one another.
</p>
<example xml:id="ex-negated-existential"><title>Negation of an Existential Quantifier</title><p> Over the universe of animals, define <m>F(x)</m>: <m>x</m> is a fish and <m>W(x)</m>: <m>x</m> lives in the water. We know that the proposition <m>W(x) \rightarrow F(x)</m> is not always true. In other words, <m>(\forall x)(W(x) \rightarrow  F(x))</m> is false. Another way of stating this fact is that there exists an animal that lives in the water and is not a fish; that is,
<me>\begin{split}
\neg (\forall x)(W(x) \to  F(x)) &amp; \Leftrightarrow (\exists  x)(\neg (W(x) \rightarrow  F(x))) \\
		&amp;  \Leftrightarrow (\exists  x)(W(x) \land  \neg F(x))
\end{split}
</me>.</p>
</example>
<p>Note that the negation of a universally quantified proposition is an existentially quantified proposition. In addition, when you negate an existentially quantified proposition, you get a universally quantified proposition.   Symbolically,

<subsection xml:id="ss-multiple-quantifiers"><title>Multiple Quantifiers</title><index><main>Quantifiers</main><sub>Multiple</sub></index>

<p>If a proposition has more than one variable, then you can quantify it more than once. For example, \(p(x, y):x^2 - y^2 = (x + y)(x - y)\) is a tautology over the set of all pairs of real numbers because it is true for each pair \((x, y)\) in \(\mathbb{R} \times  \mathbb{R}\). Another way to look at this proposition is as a proposition with two variables. The assertion that \(p(x,y)\) is a tautology could be quantified as \((\forall x)_{\mathbb{R}} ((\forall y) _{\mathbb{R}}(p(x, y)))\) or \((\forall y)_{\mathbb{R}} ((\forall x) _{\mathbb{R}}(p(x, y)))\)</p>

<p>In general, multiple universal quantifiers can be arranged in any order without logically changing the meaning of the resulting proposition. The same is true for multiple existential quantifiers. For example, \(p(x, y) : x + y = 4 \textrm{ and } x - y = 2\) is a proposition over \(\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}\). \((\exists x)_{\mathbb{R}} ((\exists y) _{\mathbb{R}} (x + y = 4 \textrm{ and } x - y = 2))\) and \((\exists y)_{\mathbb{R}}\textrm{ } ((\exists x) _{\mathbb{R}} (x + y = 4 \textrm{ and } x - y = 2))\) are equivalent. A proposition with multiple existential quantifiers such as this one says that there are simultaneous values for the quantified variables that make the proposition true. A similar example is \(q(x, y) : 2x - y - 2 \textrm{ and }4x - 2y = 5\), which is always false; and the following are all equivalent:
</p>
<p><me>
\begin{split}
\neg ((\exists  x)_{\mathbb{R}}((\exists  y) _{\mathbb{R}}(q(x, y)))) 
	&amp; \Leftrightarrow  \neg (\exists  y)_{\mathbb{R}}((\exists x)_{\mathbb{R}}(q(x, y)))) \\
	&amp; \Leftrightarrow (\forall y)_{\mathbb{R}} (\neg ((\exists  x)_{\mathbb{R}}(q(x,y))) \\
   &amp; \Leftrightarrow ((\forall y)_{\mathbb{R}} ((\forall x)_{\mathbb{R}} (\neg q(x, y))))\\
	&amp; \Leftrightarrow ((\forall x)_{\mathbb{R}} ((\forall y)_{\mathbb{R}} (\neg q(x, y))))
\end{split}
</me>
</p>


<p>When existential and universal quantifiers are mixed, the order cannot be exchanged without possibly changing the meaning of the proposition. For example, let \(\mathbb{R}^+\) be the positive real numbers, \(x : (\forall a)_{\mathbb{R}^+} ((\exists  b)_{\mathbb{R}^+} (a b = 1))\) and \(y : (\exists  b)_{\mathbb{R}^+} ((\forall a)_{\mathbb{R}^+}(a b = 1))\) have different logical values; <m>x</m> is true, while <m>y</m> is false.</p>


<p><em>Tips on Reading Multiply-Quantified Propositions.</em>
It is understandable that you would find propositions such as <m>x</m> difficult to read. The trick to deciphering these expressions is to <q>peel</q> one quantifier off the proposition just as you would peel off the layers of an onion (but quantifiers shouldn't make you cry). Since the outermost quantifier in <m>x</m> is universal, <m>x</m> says that \(z(a) : (\exists  b)_{\mathbb{R}^+}(a b = 1)\) is true for each value that a can take on. Now take the time to select a value for <m>a</m>, like 6. For the value that we selected, we get \(z(6) : (\exists b)_{\mathbb{R}^+}(6b = 1)\), which is obviously true since \(6b = 1\) has a solution in the positive real numbers. We will get that same truth value no matter which positive
real number we choose for <m>a</m>; therefore, \(z(a)\) is a tautology over \(\mathbb{R}^+\) and we are justified in saying that <m>x</m> is true. The key to understanding propositions like <m>x</m> on your own is to experiment with actual values for the outermost variables as we did above.</p>

<p>Now consider <m>y</m>. To see that <m>y</m> is false, we peel off the outer quantifier. Since it is an existential quantifier, all that <m>y</m> says is that some positive real number makes \(w(b)\) : \((\forall a) _{\mathbb{R}^+} (a b = 1)\) true. Choose a few values of <m>b</m> to see if you can find one that makes \(w(b)\) true. For example, if we pick \(b = 2\), we get \((\forall a) _{\mathbb{R}^+}(2a = 1)\), which is false, since \(2a\) is almost always different from 1. You should be able to convince yourself that no value of <m>b</m> will make \(w(b)\) true.  Therefore, <m>y</m> is false.</p>
<p>Another way of convincing yourself that \(y\) is false is to convince yourself that \(\neg y\) is true:
<me>
\begin{split}
\neg ((\exists  b)_{\mathbb{R}^+} ((\forall a)_{\mathbb{R}^+}(a b = 1))) 
	&amp;\Leftrightarrow (\forall  b)_{\mathbb{R}^+}\neg ((\forall a)_{\mathbb{R}^+}(a b = 1))\\
	&amp; \Leftrightarrow (\forall  b)_{\mathbb{R}^+} ((\exists a)_{\mathbb{R}^+}(a b \neq  1))
\end{split}
</me>
In words, for each value of <m>b</m>, there is a value for <m>a</m> that makes \(a b \neq  1\).  One such value is \(a=\frac{1}{b}+1\).  Therefore,  \(\neg y\) is true.</p>
