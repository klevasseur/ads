<introduction>
<p>The common thread that connects all of the problems in this section is the desire to optimize (maximize or minimize) a quantity that is associated with a graph. We will concentrate most of our attention on two of these problems, the Traveling Salesman Problem and the Maximum Flow Problem. At the close of this section, we will discuss some other common optimization problems.</p>

<subsection xml:id="ss-traveling-salesman-problem"><title>The Traveling Salesman Problem</title><index><main>The Traveling Salesman Problem</main></index>
<p>The Traveling Salesman Problem is, given a weighted graph, to find a circuit \(\left(e_1, e_2,\ldots ,e_n\right)\) that visits every vertex at least once and minimizes the sum of the weights, \(\sum_{i=1}^n w\left(e_i\right)\).  Any such circuit is called an  optimal path.</p>

<p>Some statements of the Traveling Salesman Problem require that the circuit be Hamiltonian. In many applications, the graph in question
will be complete and this restriction presents no problem.  If the weight on each edge is constant, for example, \(w(e) = 1\), then an optimal path would be any Hamiltonian circuit.</p>

<example xml:id="ex-boston-salesman"><title>The problem of a Boston salesman</title><p> The Traveling Salesman Problem gets its name from the situation of a salesman who wants to minimize the number of miles that
he travels in visiting his customers. For example, if a salesman from Boston must visit the other capital cities of New England, then the problem is to find a circuit in the weighted graph of <xref ref="ex-distance-graph" autoname="yes"/>. Note that distance and cost are clearly related in this case. In addition, tolls and traffic congestion might also be taken into account. 
</p></example>


<p>The search for an efficient algorithm that solves the Traveling Salesman has occupied researchers for years. If the graph in question is complete,
there are \((n -1)!\) different circuits. As <m>n</m> gets large, it is impossible to check every possible circuit. The most efficient algorithms
for solving the Traveling Salesman Problem take an amount of time that is proportional to \(n 2^n\). Since this quantity grows so quickly, we can't
expect to have the time to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem for large values of <m>n</m>. Most of the useful algorithms that have been developed
have to be heuristic; that is, they find a circuit that should be close to the optimal one. One such algorithm is the <q>closest neighbor</q> algorithm,
one of the earliest attempts at solving the Traveling Salesman Problem. The general idea behind this algorithm is, starting at any vertex, to visit
the closest neighbor to the starting point. At each vertex, the next vertex that is visited is the closest one that has not been reached. This shortsighted
approach typifies heuristic algorithms called  greedy algorithms, which attempt to solve a minimization (maximization) problem
by minimizing (maximizing) the quantity associated with only the first step.</p>

<algorithm xml:id="alg-closest-neighbor"><title>The Closest Neighbor Algorithm</title><index><main>Closest Neighbor Algorithm</main></index><statement> Let \(G = (V, E, w)\) be a complete weighted graph with \(|V| = n\). The closest neighbor

<p>The cost of the closest neighbor circuit is
\(\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} w\left(v_k,v_{k+1}\right)+w\left(v_n,v_1\right)\)</p>
</statement>
</algorithm>

<example xml:id="ex-tsp-small-example"><title>A small example</title><p> The closest neighbor circuit starting at A in Figure 9.5.2 is \((1,3,2,4,1)\), with a cost of 29. The optimal path is \((1,2,3,4,1)\),
with a cost of 27.</p>

                </image>
            </figure>
</example>



<p>Although the closest neighbor circuit is often not optimal, we may be satisfied if it is close to optimal. If \(C_{\text{opt}}\) and \(C_{\text{cn}}\)
are the costs of optimal and closest neighbor circuits in a graph, then it is always the case that \(C_{\text{opt}}\leq C_{\text{cn}}\) or \(\frac{C_{\text{cn}}}{C_{\text{opt}}}\geq
1\). We can assess how good the closest neighbor algorithm is by determining how small the quantity \(\frac{C_{\text{cn}}}{C_{\text{opt}}}\) gets.
If it is always near 1, then the algorithm is good. However, if there are graphs for which it is large, then the algorithm may be discarded. Note
that in <xref ref="ex-tsp-small-example" autoname="yes"/>, \(\frac{C_{\text{cn}}}{C_{\text{opt}}} = \frac{29}{27}\approx 1.074\). A 7 percent increase in cost may or may not be considered
significant, depending on the situation.</p>

<example xml:id="ex-9.5.4."><title>9.5.4.</title><p> A salesman must make stops at vertices A, B, and C, which are all on the same one-way street. The graph in Figure <xref ref="fig-directed-tsp-example" autoname="yes"/> is weighted by the function \(w(i, j)\) equal to the time it takes to drive from vertex <m>i</m> to vertex <m>j</m>.</p>
       <figure xml:id="fig-directed-tsp-example">
                <image width="400" source="images/fig-directed-tsp-example.png">
                    <description>A small directed weighted graph</description>
                </image>
            </figure>

<p>Note that if <m>j</m> is down the one-way street from <m>i</m>, then \(w(i, j) &lt; w(j, i)\). The values of \(C_{\text{opt}}\) , and \(C_{\text{cn}}\)
are 20 and 32, respectively. Verify that \(C_{\text{cn}}\) is 32 by using the closest neighbor algorithm. The value of \(\frac{C_{\text{cn}}}{C_{\text{opt}}} = 1.6\) is significant in this case since our salesman would spend 60 percent more time on the road if he used the closest neighbor algorithm.</p>
  </example>

<p>A more general result relating to the closest neighbor algorithm presumes that the graph in question is complete and that the weight function satisfies the conditions</p> 

<ul>
<li><p> \(w(x, v) = w(y, x)\) for all  x, y in the vertex set, and </p></li>
<li><p> \(w(x, y) + w(y, z) \geq  w(x, z)\) for all  x, y, z in the vertex set.</p></li>
</ul>



<p>The first condition is called the  symmetry condition and the second is the  triangle inequality.</p>

<theorem xml:id="th-cn-theorem-9-5"><index><main></main></index><\
statement><p>If \((V, E, w)\) is a complete weighted graph that satisfies the symmetry and triangle inequality conditions, then
\[\frac{C_{\text{cn}}}{C_{\text{opt}}}\leq \frac{\left\lceil \log _2 (2n)\right\rceil }{2}\]</p></statement></theorem>


<observation>
<p>If \(|V|=8\), then this theorem says that \(C_{\text{cn}}\) can be no larger than twice the size of \(C_{\text{opt}}\); however,
it doesn't say that the closest neighbor circuit will necessarily be that far from an optimal circuit. The quantity \(\frac{\left\lceil \log _2 (2n)\right\rceil
}{2}\) is called an upper bound for the ratio \(\frac{C_{\text{cn}}}{C_{\text{opt}}}\). It tells us only that things can't be any worse than the
upper bound. Certainly, there are many graphs with eight vertices such that the optimal and closest neighbor circuits are the same. What is left
unstated in this theorem is whether there are graphs for which the quantities in 9.5a are equal. If there are such graphs, we say that the upper
bound is  sharp.</p>
<p> The value of \(\frac{C_{\text{cn}}}{C_{\text{opt}}}\) in Example 9.5.4 is 1.6, which is greater than \(\frac{\left\lceil \log _2 (2\ 4)\right\rceil
}{2} = 1.5\); however, the weight function in this example does not satisfy the conditions of the theorem.</p>
</observation>



<example xml:id="ex-unit-square"><title>The Unit Square Problem</title><p>Suppose a robot is programmed to weld joints on square metal plates. Each plate must be welded at prescribed points on the square.
To minimize the time it takes to complete the job, the total distance that a robot's arm moves should be minimized. Let \(d(P, Q)\) be the distance
between <m>P</m> and <m>Q</m>. Assume that before each plate can be welded, the arm must be positioned at a certain point \(P_0\) . Given
a list of <m>n</m> points, we want to put them in order so that



      \[d\left(P _0,P_1\right) + d\left(P_1,P _2 \right) +\cdots +d\left(P_{n-1},P_n\right)+ d\left(P_n ,P _0 \right)\]

is as small as possible.</p></example>




<p>The type of problem that is outlined in the example above is of such importance that it is one of the most studied version of the Traveling Salesman Problem. What follows is the usual statement of the problem. Let \([0, 1] = \{x \in \mathbb{R} |\text{  }0 \leq x\leq  1\}\), and let \(S = [0,1]^2\), the unit square. Given <m>n</m> pairs of real numbers \(\left(x_1, y_1\right)\), \(\left(x_2,y_2\right)\), \dots, \(\left(x_n,y_n\right)\)
in <m>S</m> that represent the <m>n</m> vertices of a \(K_n\) , find a circuit of the graph that minimizes the sum of the distances traveled
in traversing the circuit.</p>

<p>Since the problem calls for a circuit, it doesn't matter which vertex we start at; assume that we will start at \(\left(x_1,y_1\right)\). Once the
problem is solved, we can always change our starting position. A function can most efficiently describe a circuit in this problem. Every bijection
\(f: \{1, . . . , n\} \to  \{1, . . . , n\}\) with \(f(1) = 1\) describes a circuit

\[\left(x_1, y_1\right),\left(x_{f(2)},y_{f(2)}\right),\ldots ,\left(x_{f(n)},y_{f(n)}\right)\\ 

Since there are \((n - 1)!\) such bijections, an examination of all possible circuits is not feasible for large values of <m>n</m>.</p>



<p>One popular heuristic algorithm is the strip algorithm: </p>

<algorithm xml:id="alg-strip-algorithm"><title>The Strip Algorithm</title><statement>
<p> Given <m>n</m> points in the unit square:</p>

<p>Phase 1:</p>
<ol label="a">
<li><p>Divide the square into \(\left\lceil \sqrt{n/2}\right\rceil\) vertical strips, as in <xref ref="fig-strip-alg-tsp" autoname="yes" />. Let d be the width of each strip. If a point lies on a boundary between two strips, consider it part of the left-hand strip.</p></li>
<li><p>Starting from the left, find the first strip that contains one of the points. Locate the starting point by selecting the first point that is encountered in that strip as you travel from bottom to top. We will assume that the first point is \(\left(x_1,y_1\right)\)</p></li>
<li xml:id="step-1-3"><p>Alternate traveling up and down the strips that contain vertices until all of the vertices have been reached.</p></li>
<li><p>Return to the starting point.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Phase 2:</p>
<ol label="a">
<li><p>Shift all strips \(d/2\) units to the right (creating a small strip on the left).</p></li>
<li><p>Repeat Steps 1.2 through 1.4 of Phase 1 with the new strips.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>When the two phases are complete, choose the shorter of the two circuits obtained.</p>
</statement>
</algorithm>

           <figure xml:id="fig-strip-alg-tsp">
                <caption>The Strip Algorithm
                </caption>
                <image width="400" source="images/fig-strip-alg-tsp.png">

            </figure>

<p>Step <xref ref="step-1"/> may need a bit more explanation. How do you travel up or down a strip? In most cases, the vertices in a strip will be vertically distributed so that the order in which they are visited is obvious. In some cases, however, the order might not be clear, as in the third strip in Phase I of
<xref ref="fig-strip-alg-tsp" autoname="yes" />. Within a strip, the order in which you visit the points (if you are going up the strip) is determined thusly: \(\left(x_i,y_i\right)\)
precedes \(\left(x_j,y_j\right)\) if \(y_i &lt;y_j\) or if \(y_i=y_j\) and \(x_i &lt; x_j\) . In traveling down a strip, replace \(y_i &lt; y_j\) with \(y_i >y_j\).</p>


<p>The selection of \(\left\lceil \sqrt{n/2}\right\rceil\) strips was made in a 1959 paper by Beardwood, Halton, and Hammersley. It balances the problems
that arise if the number of strips is too small or too large. If the square is divided into too few strips, some strips may be packed with vertices
so that visiting them would require excessive horizontal motion. If too many strips are used, excessive vertical motion tends to be the result. An update on what is known about this algorithm is contained in the paper by K. J. Supowit, E. M. Reingold, and D. A. Plaisted.</p>



<p>Since the construction of a circuit in the square consists of sorting the given points, it should come as no surprise that the strip algorithm requires
a time that is roughly a multiple of \(n \log  n\) time units when <m>n</m> points are to be visited.</p>



<p>The worst case that has been encountered with this algorithm is one in which the circuit obtained has a total distance of approximately \(\sqrt{2n}\)
(see Sopowit et al.).</p>

<subsection xml:id="ss-networks-and-flows"><title>Networks and the Maximum Flow Problem</title><index><main>Networks</main></index>

<definition xml:id="def-network"><title>Network</title><index><main> Network</main></index>
<statement><p> A network is a simple weighted directed graph that contains two distinguished vertices called the  source and the  sink with the properties that the indegree of the source and outdegree of the sink are both zero, and source is connected to sink.  The weight function on network is the capacity function, which as positive weights. </p></statement></definition>


<p>An example of a real situation that can be represented by a network is a city's water system. A reservoir would be the source, while a distribution
point in the city to all of the users would be the sink. The system of pumps and pipes that carries the water from source to sink makes up the remaining
network. We can assume that the water that passes through a pipe in one minute is controlled by a pump and the maximum rate is determined by the
size of the pipe and the strength of the pump. This maximum rate of flow through a pipe is called its capacity and is the information that the weight
function of a network contains.</p>

<example xml:id="ex-city-water"><title>A City Water System</title><p> Consider the system that is illustrated in <xref ref="fig-water-system" autoname="yes" />. The numbers that appear next to each pipe indicate the capacity of

<p>Although the material passing through this network is water, networks can also represent the flow of other materials, such as automobiles, electricity, bits, telephone calls, or patients in a health system.</p>
</example>
<problem xml:id="problem-maximal-flow"><title>The Maximum Flow Problem</title><statement>
<p>The Maximum Flow Problem is derived from the objective of moving the maximum amount of water or other material from the source to the sink. To measure this amount, we define a flow as a function \(f: E \to \mathbb{R}\) such that (1) the flow of material through any edge is nonnegative and no larger
than its capacity: \(0 \leq  f(e) \leq  w(e)\), for all \(e\in  E\); and (2) for each vertex other than the source and sink, the total amount of material that is directed into a vertex is equal to the total amount that is directed out:

<mdn><mrow xml:id="flow-rules">\begin{array}{ccc}
 \sum_{(x,v)\in E} f(x,v)  &amp; = &amp; \sum_{(v,y)\in E} f(v,y) \\
 \text{Flow} \text{into} v &amp; = &amp; \text{Flow} \text{out} \text{of} v \\
\end{array}</mrow></mdn>

The summation notation on the left of <xref ref="flow-rules" /> represents the sum of the flows through each edge in <m>E</m> that has <m>v</m> as a terminal vertex.
The right-hand side indicates that you should add all of the flows through edges that initiate at <m>v</m>.</p>
</statement>
</problem>

<theorem xml:id="theorem-flow-inout"><title>Flow out of Source equals Flow in Sink</title>
<statement><p> If <m>f</m> is a flow, then
<m>\quad \quad</m>\(\sum_{(\text{source},v)\in E} f(\text{source},v)\text{  }=\sum_{(v,\text{sink})\in E} f(v,\text{sink})\)  </p></statement><proof>Subtract the right-hand side of <xref ref="flow-rules" /> from the left-hand side. The result is: 
\[\text{Flow} \text{into} v - \text{Flow} \text{out} \text{of} v = 0\]

 Now sum up these differences for each vertex in \(V' = V - \{\text{source}, \text{sink}\}\). The result is
<mdn><mrow xml:id="proof-step-9-5">\sum_{v\in V'}  \left(\sum_{(x,v)\in E} f(x,v)-\sum_{(v,y)\in E} f(v,y)\right)= 0</mrow></mdn>

</p>

<p>Now observe that if an edge connects two vertices in V, its flow appears as both a positive and a negative term in <xref ref="proof-step-9-5"/>. This means that the only positive terms that are not cancelled out are the flows into the sink. In addition, the only negative terms that remain are the flows out of the
source. Therefore,
\[\sum_{(v,\text{sink})\in E} f(v,\text{sink})-\sum_{(\text{source},v)\in E} f(\text{source},v) =0\]</p>
</proof></theorem>
<definition xml:id="def-value-of-flow"><title>The Value of a Flow</title><index><main>Value of a Flow</main></index> <notation><usage>V(f)</usage><description>The value of flow <m>f</m></description></notation>
<statement><p>The common value, as proven in <xref ref="theorem-flow-inout" autoname="yes" />, flow into the sink and flow out of the source, is called the value of the flow. It is denoted by \(V(f)\). The value of a flow represents the amount of material that passes through the network with that flow.</p></statement></definition>
<p>Since the Maximum Flow Problem consists of maximizing the amount of material that passes through a given network, it is equivalent to finding a flow with the largest possible value. Any such flow is called a <term>maximal flow</term><index><main>maximal flow</main></index>.</p>

<p>For the network in <xref ref="fig-water-network" autoname="yes"/>, one flow is \(f_1\), defined by \(f_1\left(e_1\right)=25\), \(f_1\left(e_2\right)=20\), \(f_1\left(e_3\right)=0\),
\(f_1\left(e_4\right)= 25\), and \(f_1\left(e_5\right)=20\). The value of \(f_1\), \(V\left(f_1\right)\), is 45. Since the total flow into the sink
can be no larger than 50 (\(w \left(e_4\right) + w \left(e_5\right) = 30 + 20\)), we can tell that \(f_1\) is not very far from the solution. Can
you improve on \(f_1\) at all? The sum of the capacities into the sink can't always be obtained by a flow. The same is true for the sum of the
capacities out of the source. In this case, the sum of the capacities out of the source is 60, which obviously can't be reached in this network.</p>
<p>A solution of the Maximum Flow Problem for this network is the maximal flow \(f_2\), where \(f_2\left(e_1\right)=25\), \(f_2\left(e_2\right)=25\),
\(f_2\left(e_3\right)=5\), \(f_2\left(e_4\right)= 30\), and \(f_2\left(e_5\right)=20\), with \(V\left(f_2\right) = 50\). This solution is not unique.
In fact, there is an infinite number of maximal flows for this problem.</p>
<p>There have been several algorithms developed to solve the Maximal Flow Problem. One of these is the Ford and Fulkerson Algorithm (FFA). The FFA consists of repeatedly finding paths in a network called flow augmenting paths until no improvement can be made in the flow that has been obtained.</p>

<definition xml:id="def-flow-augmenting-path"><title>Flow Augmenting Path.</title><index><main>Flow Augmenting Path</main></index>
<statement><p>Given a flow <m>f</m> in a network \((V, E)\), a flow augmenting path with respect to <m>f</m> is a simple path from the
source to the sink using edges both in their forward and their reverse directions such that for each edge <m>e</m> in the path, \(w(e) - f(e) > 0\) if <m>e</m> is used in its forward direction and \(f(e) > 0\) if <m>e</m> is used in the reverse direction.
</p></statement></definition>

 


<example xml:id="example-water-augmenting"><title>Augmenting City Water Flow</title>
<p>For \(f_1\) in Example 9.5.6, a flow augmenting path would be\(\left(e_2 , e_3 , e_4 \right)\) since
\(w\left(e_2\right)-f_1\left(e_2\right)= 15\), \(w\left(e_3\right)-f_1\left(e_3\right)=5\), and \(w\left(e_4\right)-f_1\left(e_4\right)=5\).</p>
<p>These positive differences represent unused capacities, and the smallest value represents the amount of flow that can be added to each edge in the path. Note that by adding 5 to each edge in our path, we obtain \(f_2\), which is maximal. If an edge with a positive flow is used in its reverse direction, it is contributing a movement of material that is counterproductive to the objective of maximizing flow. This is why the
algorithm directs us to decrease the flow through that edge.</p></example>

<ol label=“1”>
<li><p> It should be clear that every flow augmenting path leads to a flow of increased value and that none of the capacities of the network can be violated.</p></li>
<li><p> The depth-first search should be used to find flow augmenting paths since it is far more efficient than the breadth-first search in this situation. The depth-first search differs from the breadth-first algorithm  in that you sequentially visit vertices
until you reach a <q>dead end</q> and then backtrack.</p></li>
<li><p> There have been networks discovered for which the FFA does not terminate in a finite number of steps. These examples all have irrational capacities. It has been proven that if all capacities are positive integers, the FFA terminates in a finite number of steps. See Ford and Fulkerson, Even, or Berge for details.</p></li>
<li><p> When you use the FFA to solve the Maximum Flow Problem by hand it is convenient to label each edge of the network with the fraction \(\left.f_i(e)\right/w(e)\).</p></li>

<hint>Count the number of comparisons of distances that must be done.</hint>
</statement>
<answer><p> To locate the closest neighbor among the list of <m>k</m> other points on the unit square requires a time proportional to <m>k</m>. Therefore
the time required for the closest-neighbor algorithm with <m>n</m> points is proportional to \((n-1)+(n-2)+\cdots +2+1\), which is proportional
to \(n^2\). Since the strip algorithm takes a time proportional to \(n(\log  n)\), it is much faster for large values of <m>n</m>.
