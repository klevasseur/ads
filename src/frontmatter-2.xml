<p>This is part 2 of <em>Applied Discrete Structures</em>.  In order to maintain uniform numbering and avoid broken links, stubs of the first ten chapters are included and contain the introduction  elements that are referenced in chapters 11 through 16.  To see all of chapters 1 through 10, visit our web page at http://faculty.uml.edu/klevasseur/ADS2.</p>
<p><em>Applied Discrete Structures</em> is designed for use in a university course in discrete mathematics spanning up to two semesters.   Its original design was for computer science majors to be introduced to the mathematical topics that are useful in computer science.   It can also serve the same purpose for mathematics majors, providing a first exposure to many essential topics.</p>
<p>We embarked on this open-source project in 2010, twenty-one years after the publication of the 2nd edition of <em>Applied Discrete Structures for Computer Science</em> in 1989.   We had signed a contract for the second edition with Science Research Associates in 1988 but by the time the book was ready to print, SRA had been sold to MacMillan. Soon after, the rights had been passed on to Pearson Education, Inc. In 2010, the long-term future of printed textbooks is uncertain. In the meantime, textbook prices (both printed and e-books) had increased and a growing open source textbook movement had started. One of our objectives in revisiting this text is to make it available to our students in an affordable format. In its original form, the text was peer-reviewed and was adopted for use at several universities throughout the country. For this reason, we see <em>Applied Discrete Structures</em> as not only an inexpensive alternative, but a high quality alternative.</p>
<p>The current version of <em>Applied Discrete Structures</em> has been developed using <em>PreTeXt</em>, a lightweight XML application for authors of scientific articles, textbooks and monographs initiated by Rob Beezer, U. of Puget Sound.  When the PreTeXt project was launched, it was the natural next step.  The features of PreTeXt make it far more readable, with easy production of web, pdf and print formats. </p>
