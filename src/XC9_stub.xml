<introduction>
<p>This is a stub for Part 2 of Applied Discrete Structures. To see the whole chapter, visit our web page at http://faculty.uml.edu/klevasseur/ADS2.</p>
<p>This chapter has three principal goals. First, we will identify the basic components of a graph and some of the features that many graphs have. Second, we will discuss some of the questions that are most commonly asked of graphs. Third, we want to make the reader aware of how graphs
are used. In Section 9.1, we will discuss these topics in general, and in later sections we will take a closer look at selected topics in graph theory.</p>

The <m>n</m>-cube is the undirected graph with a vertex for each string in <m>B^n</m> and an edge connecting each pair of strings that differ in exactly one position. The <m>n</m>-cube is normally denoted <m>Q_n</m>. </p></statement></definition>
