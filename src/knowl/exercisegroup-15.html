<div class="exercisegroup">A Exercises<article class="exercise-like" id="exercise-74"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">1</span></h5> List all partitions of the set \(A =\{a, b, c\}\).

<article class="exercise-like" id="exercise-76"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">3</span></h5>A student, on an exam paper, defined the term partition the following way: "Let \(A\)  be a set. A partition of \(A\) is any set of nonempty subsets \(A_1, A_2, A_3, \dots\)  of \(A\) such that each element of A is in one of the subsets."  Is this definition correct? Why?

<article class="exercise-like" id="exercise-77"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">4</span></h5> Let \(A_1\) and \(A_2\) be subsets of a set \(U\).   Draw a Venn diagram of this situation and shade in the subsets \(A_1 \cap A_2\), \(A_1^c \cap A_2\),\(A_1 \cap A_2^c\),and \(A_1^c \cap A_2^c\) . Use the resulting diagram and the definition of partition to convince yourself that the subset of these four subsets that are nonempty form a partition of \(U\).

<article class="exercise-like" id="exercise-79"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">6</span></h5> (a) A group of 30 students were surveyed and it was found that 18 of them took Calculus and 12 took Physics. If all students took at least one course, how many took both Calculus and Physics? Illustrate using a Venn diagram.\\
 (b) What is the answer to the question in part (a) if five students did not take either of the two courses? Illustrate using a Venn diagram.

<article class="exercise-like" id="exercise-81"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">8</span></h5>A survey of 300 people found that 60 owned an iPhone 75 owned an Blackberry, and 30 owned an Android. Furthermore, 40 owned both an iPhone and Blackberry, 12 owned both an iPhone and Android, and 8 owned a Blackberry and an Android. Finally, 3 owned all three phones.\\
 (a) How many people surveyed owned none of the three phones?\\
 (b) How many people owned an Blackberry but not an iPhone?\\
 (c) How many owned a Blackberry but not an Android?\\
