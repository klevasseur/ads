<title>Basic Counting Techniques - The Rule of Products</title>
<subsection xml:id="What-is-Combinatorics"><title>What is Combinatorics?</title>
<p>
 One of the first concepts our parents taught us was the <q>art of counting.</q> We were taught to raise three fingers to indicate that we were three years old. The question of <q>how many</q> is a natural and frequently asked question. Combinatorics is the <q>art of counting.</q> It is the study of techniques that will help us to count the number of objects in a set quickly. Highly sophisticated results can be obtained with this simple concept. The following examples will illustrate that many questions concerned with counting involve the same process.
</p>

<example xml:id="lunch-possibilies1"><title>How many lunches can you have?</title><p>A snack bar serves five different sandwiches and three different beverages. How many different lunches can a person order? One way of determining the number of possible lunches is by listing or enumerating all the possibilities. One systematic way of doing this is by means of a tree, as in the following figure.</p>
            <figure xml:id="lunch">
                <caption>Tree diagram to enumerate the number of possible lunches.
                </caption>
                <image width="50%" source="images/lunch.png">
                    <description><p>Tree diagram to enumerate the number of possible lunches. Starting at a node labeled Start, there are five branches, one for each possible sandwich that can be ordered.  For each sandwich node there are three branches emanating from it, one for each possible beverage. The result is fifteen end nodes, one for each possible lunch.</p></description>
                </image>
            </figure>
<p>
 Every path that begins at the position labeled START and goes to the right can be interpreted as a choice of one of the five sandwiches followed by a choice of one of the three beverages. Note that considerable work is required to arrive at the number fifteen this way; but we also get more than just a number. The result is a complete list of all possible lunches. If we need to answer a question that starts with <q>How many . . . ,</q> enumeration would be done only as a last resort. In a later chapter we will examine more enumeration techniques.
</p>
<p>
 An alternative method of solution for this example is to make the simple observation that there are five different choices for sandwiches and three different choices for beverages, so there are <m>5 \cdot 3 = 15</m> different lunches that can be ordered.
</p>
</example>
<example xml:id="cartesian-cardinality">
<title>Counting elements in a cartesian product</title> 
<p>Let <m>A = \{a, b, c, d, e\}</m> and <m>B = \{1,2,3\}</m>. From Chapter 1 we know how to list the elements in <m>A \times B = \{(a, 1), (a, 2), (a, 3), ..., (e, 3)\}</m>.  Since the first entry of each pair can be any one of the five elements <m>a, b, c, d</m>, and <m>e</m>, and since the second can be any one of the three numbers 1, 2, and 3, it is quite clear there are 
<m>5 \cdot 3 = 15</m> different elements in <m>A \times B</m>.
</p>
</example>
<example xml:id="questionnaire"><title>A True-False Questionnaire</title><p>A person is to complete a true-false questionnaire consisting of ten questions. How many different ways are there to answer the questionnaire? Since each question can be answered in either of two ways (true or false), and there are ten questions, there are <me> 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 = 2^{10} = 1024</me> different ways of answering the questionnaire. The reader is encouraged to visualize the tree diagram of this example, but not to draw it!</p>
</example>

<p>
 We formalize the procedures developed in the previous examples with the following rule and its extension.

	<title>The Rule Of Products</title>
	<idx>Rule Of Products, The</idx>
	<idx><h>Products</h><h>Rule of</h></idx>
	<statement><p>If two operations must be performed, and if the first operation can always be performed <m>p_1</m> different ways and the second operation can always be performed <m>p_2</m> different ways, then there are <m>p_1 p_2</m> different ways that the two operations can be performed.
</p></statement>
</theorem>
<p>
Note: It is important that <m>p_2</m> does not depend on the option that is chosen in the first operation. Another way of saying this is that <m>p_2</m> is independent of the first operation. If <m>p_2</m> is dependent on the first operation, then the rule of products does not apply.
</p>
<example xml:id="lunch-possibilites2"><title>Reduced Lunch Possibilities</title><statement><p>Assume in <xref ref="lunch-possibilies1" />, coffee is not served with a beef or chicken sandwiches. Then by inspection of <xref ref="lunch" /> we see that there are only thirteen different choices for lunch. The rule of products does not apply, since the choice of beverage depends on one's choice of a sandwich.</p></statement>
</example>
<p> The rule of products can be extended to include sequences of more than two operations.</p>
<theorem xml:id="prop-extended-rule-of-products">

<statement><p> If <m>n</m> operations must be performed, and the number of options for each operation is <m>p_1</m>, <m>p_2, \dots, p_n</m> respectively, with each <m>p_i</m>  independent of previous choices, then the <m>n</m> operations can be performed <m>p_1 \cdot p_2 \cdot \cdots \cdot p_n</m> different ways.
</p></statement>
</theorem>
<example xml:id="another_questionnaire"><title>A Multiple Choice Questionnaire</title><p>A questionnaire contains four questions that have two possible answers and three questions with five possible answers. Since the answer to each question is independent of the answers to the other questions, the extended rule of products applies and there are
<m>2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 5 \cdot 5 \cdot 5 = 2^4 \cdot 5^3 = 2000 </m> different ways to answer the questionnaire.</p>
</example>
<p>
 In Chapter 1 we introduced the power set of a set <m>A</m>, <m>\mathcal{P}(A)</m>, which is the set of all subsets of <m>A</m>. Can we predict how many elements are in <m>\mathcal{P}(A)</m> for a given finite set <m>A</m>? The answer is yes, and in fact if <m>\lvert A \rvert  = n</m>, then <m>\lvert \mathcal{P}(A) \rvert = 2^{n}</m>.  The ease with which we can prove this fact demonstrates the power and usefulness of the rule of products. Do not underestimate the usefulness of simple ideas.

<statement><p>If <m>A</m> is a finite set, then <m>\lvert \mathcal{P}(A) \rvert = 2^{\lvert A \rvert }</m>.</p></statement>
<proof><p>
Proof: Consider how we might determine any <m>B \in \mathcal{P}(A)</m>, where <m> \lvert A \rvert =n</m>. For each element <m>x \in A</m> there are two choices, either <m>x \in B</m> or <m>x \notin B</m>.  Since there are <m>n</m>  elements of <m>A</m>  we have, by the rule of products, 
  <me>\underset{n \textrm{ factors}}{\underline{2 \cdot 2 \cdot  \cdots \cdot 2}}=  2^n</me>   different subsets of <m>A</m>. Therefore, <m>\mathcal{P}(A)= 2^{n}</m>.

<answer> <p>If we always include the blazer in the outfit we would have 6 outfits. If we
consider the blazer optional then there would be 12 outfits. When we add a
sweater we have the same type of choice. Considering the sweater optional
produces 24 outfits.</p>

<exercise number="8"><statement><p> As a freshman, suppose you had to take two of four lab science courses, one of two literature courses, two of three math courses, and one of seven physical education courses. Disregarding possible time conflicts, how many different schedules do you have to choose from?</p></statement>
<answer component="im"><p>The only tricky thing about this problem is that in choosing the two lab science courses, there are just six possible choices.  This is because the order in which the courses are selected isn't indicated as being significant.  For example, if chemistry and biology are among the courses, choosing chamistry and then biology is the same as choosing biology and then chemistry, so although it may appear that there are <m>4 \times 3</m> ways of picking lab science courses, there are only half that many.  The number of ways to select other courses is more obvous.  For the math courses, there are three choices because we need only decide which course to not take.  So the number of ways to pick courses (not taking into account times) is <m>6 \times 2 \times 3 \times 7 = 252</m>.</p>

<exercise number="18"><statement><p> Six people are invited to a dinner party. How many ways are there of seating them at a round table? If the six people consist of three who identify as male and three who identify as female, how many ways are there of seating them if each male must be surrounded by two females?  Assume we are only concerned with the relative positions around the table.  So if we rotate everyone we wouldn't consider this a change in the seating.</p></statement>
<answer component="im"><p> With no restrictions on seating, we can select any person in the party and seat them at the table.  Then to their left we have five choices for seating someone and next to the left there are  4 choices, etc.   The number of choices in all is then <m>5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 = 120</m>.  With the alternate male/female scheme, if we seat any male, there are three choices for the female to the left, two choices for the male who is further left, two choices for the female to the right and the other two individuals have their seats determined at this point.  So the number of possibilities is <m>3 \times 2^2 = 12</m>.</p>

<exercise number="20"><statement><p> A gardener has three flowering shrubs and four nonflowering shrubs, where all shrubs are distinguishable from one another. He must plant these shrubs in a row using an alternating pattern, that is, a shrub must be of a different type from that on either side. How many ways can he plant these shrubs? If he has to plant these shrubs in a circle using the same pattern, how many ways can he plant this circle? Note that one nonflowering shrub will be left out at the end.</p></statement>
<answer component="im"><p>If you arrange the shrubs in a row, the nonflowering shrubs must be in positions 1, 3, 5 and 7.  We assume that reversing the order would be considered different.  So the number of orderings of the nonflowering shubs would be <m>4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 24</m>.  The flowering shrubs in positions 22, 4 and 6 can be arranged <m>3 \times 2 \times 1 = 6</m> ways and so the number of possible row arrangements is <m>24 \times 6 = 144</m>.  For the circular arrangement, we can decide which nonflowering shrub to not include in the arrangement four ways.  Once we have done this, we have the same situation as the dinner party above where we specified  male/female alternation.  So there are 12 ways to arrange the shrubs.  Therefore we have <m>4 \times 12 = 48</m> possible arrangements of the shrubs in a circle.  Let's put the remaining one in the center! </p>
