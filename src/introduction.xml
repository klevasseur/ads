<preface><title>What is Discrete Mathematics?</title>
<p>As a general description one could say that discrete mathematics is the mathematics that deals with <q>separated</q> or discrete sets of objects
rather than with continuous sets such as the real line. For example, the graphs that we learn to draw in high school are of continuous functions.
Even though we might have begun by plotting discrete points on the plane, we usually connected them with a smooth curve to form a straight
line, parabola, circle, etc.</p>

<p>Today, the area of mathematics that is broadly called <q>discrete</q> is that which professionals feel is essential for people who use the computer as a fundamental tool. It involves topics such as sets, logic, and matrices
that students may be already familiar with to some degree. Also it incudes basic mathematical concepts such as relations and functions. These topics are applied to subjects that include recursion, graph theory, trees, and abstract algebra.</p>

<example xml:id="ex-intro-logic-design"><title>Logic Design</title><p>Logic is the cornerstone of all communication, whether we wish to communicate in mathematics or in any other language. It is
the study of sentences, or propositions, that take on the values true or false, 1 or 0 in the binary system. Its importance was recognized in the
very early days of the development of logic (hardware) design, where Boolean algebra, the algebra of logic, was used to simplify electronic circuitry
called gate diagrams. Consider the following gate diagram:</p>

          <figure xml:id="fig-intro-gates">
                <caption>A logic diagram for <m>(x_1 \lor (x_1 \land x_2))\land (x_1 \lor \bar{x_3})</m>
                </caption>
                <image width="100%" source="images/fig-intro-gates.png">
                    <description>A logic diagram</description>
                </image>
            </figure>

<p>The symbols with heavy line borders in this diagram are called a gates, each a piece of hardware. In Chapter 13 we will discuss these circuits in detail. Assume that this circuitry
can be placed on a chip which will have a cost dependent on the number of gates involved. A classic problem in logic design is to try to simplify
this circuitry to one containing fewer gates. Indeed, the gate diagram can be reduced to the  following diagram.</p>
    <figure xml:id="fig-intro-gates-reduced">
                <caption>A reduced logic diagram for <m>x_1 \lor (x_2 \land \bar{x_3})</m>
                </caption>
                <image width="100%" source="images/fig-intro-gates-reduced.png">
                    <description>A reduced logic diagram</description>
                </image>
            </figure>
<p>The result is a less costly chip. Since a company making computers uses millions of chips, we have saved a substantial amount of money.</p>


<p>This use of logic is only the <q>tip of the iceberg.</q> The importance of logic for computer scientists in particular, and for all people who use
mathematics, cannot be overestimated. It is the means by which we can think and write clearly and precisely. Logic is used in writing algorithms,
in testing the correctness of programs, and in other areas of computer science.</p>

</example>
<example xml:id="ex-intro-recurrence"><title>Recurrence Relations</title><p> Suppose two students miss a class on a certain day and borrow the class notes in order to obtain copies. If one of them copies
the notes by hand and the other walks to a <q>copy shop,</q> we might ask which method is more efficient. To keep things simple, we will only consider
the time spent in copying, not the cost. We add a few more assumptions: copying the first page by hand takes one minute and forty seconds (100 seconds);
for each page copied by hand, the next page will take five more seconds to copy, so that it takes 1:45 to copy the second page, 1:50 to copy the
third page, etc.; photocopiers take five seconds to copy one page; walking to the <q>copy shop</q> takes ten minutes, each way.</p>


<p>One aspect of the problem that we have not specified is the number of pages to be copied. Suppose the number of pages is <m>n</m>, which could be any positive
integer. As with many questions of efficiency, one method is not clearly better than the other for all cases. Since the only variable in this problem
is the number of pages, we can simply compare the copying times for different values of \textit{ n}. We will denote the time it takes (in seconds)
to copy \textit{ n} pages manually by <m>t_h(n)</m>, and the time to copy n pages automatically by <m>t_a(n)</m>. Ideally, we would like to have formulas
to represent the values of <m>t_h(n)</m> and <m>t_a(n)</m>. The process of finding these formulas is an important one that we will examine in Chapter 8.
{ }The formula for <m>t_a(n)</m> is not very difficult to derive from the given information. To copy pages automatically, one must walk
for twenty minutes (1,200 seconds), and then for each page wait five seconds. Therefore, <m>t_a(n)=1200 + 5n</m>. </p>


<p>The formula for <m>t_h(n)</m> isn't quite as simple. First, let <m>p(n)</m> be the number of seconds that it takes to copy page \textit{ n}. From the assumptions,
<m>p(1) = 100</m>, and if <m>n</m> is greater than one, <m>p(n) = p(n-1) + 5</m>. The last formula is called a \textit{ recurrence relation}. We will spend
quite a bit of time discussing methods for deriving formulas from recurrence relations. In this case <m>p(n) = 95 + 5n</m>. Now we can see that if <m>n</m> is greater than one,

<me>t_h(n)= p(1)+p(2)+\cdots +p(n)= t_h(n-1)+p(n)=t_h(n-1)+5 n+95</me>

This is yet another recurrence relation. The solution to this one is <m>t_h(n)=97.5 n+2.5 n^2</m>.</p>


<p>Now that we have these formulas, we can analyze them to determine the values of <m>n</m> for which hand copying is most efficient, the values
for which photocopying is most efficient, and also the values for which the two methods require the same amount of time.</p>

<p><em>What is Discrete Structures?</em></p>
<p>So far we have given you several examples of that area of mathematics called discrete mathematics. Where does the <q>structures</q> part of the
title come from? We will look not only at the topics of discrete mathematics but at the structure of these topics. If two people were to explain
a single concept, one in German and one in French, we as observers might at first think they were expressing two different ideas, rather than the
same idea in two different languages. In mathematics we would like to be able to make the same distinction. Also, when we come upon a new mathematical
structure, say the algebra of sets, we would like to be able to determine how workable it will be. How do we do this? We compare it to something
we know, namely elementary algebra, the algebra of numbers. When we encounter a new algebra we ask ourselves how similar it is to elementary algebra.
What are the similarities and the dissimilarities? When we know the answers to these questions we can use our vast knowledge of basic algebra to
build upon rather than learning each individual concept from the beginning.</p>
