<introduction>
<p>In this section we introduce directed graphs as a way to visualize relations on a set. </p>
</introduction>
<subsection><title>Digraphs</title>
<p>Let <m>A = \{0, 1,2,3\}</m>, and let  <me>r = \{(0, 0), (0, 3), (1, 2), (2, 1), (3, 2), (2, 0)\}</me>
In representing this relation as a graph, elements of <m>A</m> are called the vertices of the graph. They are typically represented by labeled points or small circles. We connect vertex <m>a</m> to vertex <m>b</m> with an arrow, called an edge, going from vertex <m>a</m> to vertex <m>b</m> if and only if <m>a r b</m>.  This type of graph of a relation <m>r</m> is called a <term>directed graph</term> or <term>digraph</term>. <xref ref="fig-graph-6-2-1" text="type-global" /> is a digraph for <m>r</m>. Notice that since 0 is related to itself, we draw a <q>self-loop</q> at 0.<idx>Directed graph</idx><idx>Digraph</idx></p>
<figure xml:id="fig-graph-6-2-1">
   <caption>Digraph of a relation </caption>
      <image width="60%" xml:id="graph-6-2-1">
         <description><p>Digraph of the relation <m>r = \{(0, 0), (0, 3), (1, 2), (2, 1), (3, 2), (2, 0)\}</m> with four nodes, 0, 1, 2, and  3;  and edges between them corresponding to the pairs in the relation. One pair, <m>(0,0)</m> is displayed as a loop starting at ending at node 0.</p></description>

					g=DiGraph({0:[0,3],1:[2],2:[1,0],3:[2]})
					f621=g.plot(layout='spring',loop_size=0.1)
					f621

      </image>
</figure>
<p>The actual location of the vertices in a digraph is immaterial. The actual location of vertices we choose is called an <term>embedding of a graph</term><idx>Embedding of a graph</idx>. The main idea is to place the vertices in such a way that the graph is easy to read. After drawing a rough-draft graph of a relation, we may decide to relocate the vertices so that the final result will be neater. <xref ref="fig-graph-6-2-1" text="type-global" /> could also
be presented as in <xref ref="fig-graph-6-2-2" text="type-global" />.</p>

         <description><p>Digraph of the relation r, alternate embedding</p></description>
					<sageplot>
					g=DiGraph({0:[0,3],1:[2],2:[1,0],3:[2]})
					f622=g.plot(pos={0:(0,0),1:(1,0),2:(1,1),3:(0,1)},loop_size=0.1)
					f622
					</sageplot>
      </image>
</figure>
<p>A vertex of a graph is also called a node, point, or a junction. An edge of a graph is also referred to as an arc, a line, or a branch. Do not be concerned if two graphs of a given relation look different as long as the connections between vertices are the same in the two graphs.</p>
<example xml:id="ex-another-simple-graph"><title>Another directed graph</title><p>Consider the relation <m>s</m> whose digraph is <xref ref="fig-graph-6-2-3" text="type-global" />. What information does this give us? The graph tells us that <m>s</m> is a relation on <m>A = \{1, 2, 3\}</m> and that <m>s = \{(1, 2), (2, 1), (1, 3), (3, 1), (2, 3), (3, 3)\}</m>.</p>
      <figure xml:id="fig-graph-6-2-3">
            <caption>Digraph of the relation <m>s</m></caption>
            <image  width="60%" xml:id="graph-6-2-3">
               <description><p>Digraph of the relation <m>s</m>.</p></description>
						<sageplot>
                  g=DiGraph({1:[2,3],2:[1,3],3:[1,3]})
                  f623=g.plot(layout="circular",loop_size=0.1)
                  f623
                  </sageplot>
            </image>
      </figure>
</example>
<p>We will be building on the next example in the following section.</p>
<example xml:id="ex-subsets-2-ordering"><title>Ordering subsets of a two element universe</title><p> Let <m>B = \{1,2\}</m>, and let <m>A = \mathcal{P}(B) = \{\emptyset, \{1\}, \{2\}, \{1,2\}\}</m>. Then <m>\subseteq</m> is a relation on <m>A</m> whose digraph is <xref ref="fig-graph-6-2-subsets-2" text="type-global" />.</p>
<figure xml:id="fig-graph-6-2-subsets-2">
   <caption>Graph for set containment on subsets of <m>\{1,2\}</m> </caption>
   <image width="60%" source="images/graph-6-2-subsets-2.png">
   <description><p>Graph for set containment on subsets  of <m>\{1,2\}</m></p></description>
   </image>
</figure>
<p>We will see in the next section that since <m>\subseteq</m> has certain structural properties that describe <q>partial orderings.</q> We will be able to draw a much simpler type graph than this one, but for now the graph above serves our purposes.</p>
