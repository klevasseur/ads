<subsection><title>Definition of Minsets</title>
<p>Let \(B_1\) and \(B_2\) be subsets of a set <m>A</m>. Notice that the Venn diagram of <xref ref="fig-minsets-2" text="type-global" /> is naturally partitioned into the subsets \(A_1\), \(A_2\), \(A_3\), and \(A_4\). Further we observe that \(A_1\), \(A_2\), \(A_3\), and \(A_4\) can be described in terms of \(B_1\) and \(B_2\) as follows:</p>

<p>Each \(A_i\) is called a minset generated by \(B_1\) and \(B_2\). We note that each minset is formed by taking the intersection of two sets where each may be either \(B_k\) or its complement, \(B_k^c\). Note also, given two sets, there are \(2^{2}=4\) minsets.</p>
<p>Minsets are occasionally called <em>minterms</em>.</p>
<p>The reader should note that if we apply all possible combinations of the operations intersection, union, and complementation to the sets \(B_1\) and \(B_2\) of Figure 4.3.1, the smallest sets generated will be exactly the minsets, the minimum sets. Hence the derivation of the term minset.</p>
<p>Next, consider the Venn diagram containing three sets, \(B_1\), \(B_2\), and \(B_3\). Draw it right now and count the regions! 
What are the minsets generated by \(B_1\), \(B_2\), and \(B_3\)? How many are there? Following the procedures outlined above, we note that the following are three of the \(2^3=8\) minsets. What are the others?</p>

<example xml:id="ex-minset-example"><title>A concrete example of some minsets</title><p>Consider the following concrete example. Let \(A = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}\) with subsets \(B_1 = \{1,3,5\}\) and \(B_2= \{1,2,3\}\). How can we use set operations applied to \(B_1\) and \(B_2\) and produce a list of sets that contain elements of <m>A</m> efficiently
without duplication? As a first attempt, we might try these three sets:</p>
<table xml:id="tab-subsets-generated-1"><caption/>
<tabular halign="center">
<row><cell>\(B_1\cap B_2=\{1,3\}\)</cell></row>
<row><cell>\(B_1^c=\{2,4,6\}\)</cell></row>
<row><cell>\(B_2^c=\{4,5,6\}\).</cell></row>
</tabular>
</table>

<p>We have produced all elements of <m>A</m> but we have 4 and 6 repeated in two sets. In place of \(B_1^c\) and \(B_2^c\), let's try \(B_1^c\cap B_2\) and \(B_1\cap B_2^c\), respectively:</p>
<table xml:id="tab-subsets-generated-2"><caption/>
<tabular halign="center">
<row><cell>\(B_1^c\cap B_2=\{2\}\) and</cell></row>
<row><cell>\(B_1\cap B_2^c=\{5\}\).</cell></row>
</tabular>
</table>
<p>We have now produced the elements 1, 2, 3, and 5 using \(B_1\cap B_2\),  \(B_1^c\cap B_2\) and \(B_1\cap B_2^c\) yet we have not listed the elements 4 and 6. Most ways that we could combine \(B_1\) and \(B_2\) such as \(B_1\cup B_2\) or \(B_1\cup B_2^c\) will produce duplications of listed
elements and will not produce both 4 and 6. However we note that \(B_1^c\cap B_2^c= \{4, 6\}\), exactly the elements we need.  Each element of <m>A</m> appears exactly once in one of the four minsets \(B_1\cap B_2\) ,  \(B_1^c\cap B_2\), \(B_1\cap B_2^c\) and \(B_1^c\cap B_2^c\). Hence, we have a partition of <m>A</m>.</p>

<theorem xml:id="th-minset-partition"><title>Minset Partition Theorem</title><statement><p> Let <m>A</m> be a set and let \(B_1\), \(B_2\) \(\ldots\)  , \(B_n\) be subsets of <m>A</m>. The set of nonempty minsets generated by  \(B_1\), \(B_2\) \(\ldots\)  , \(B_n\) is a partition of <m>A</m>.</p>
</statement><proof><p>The proof of this theorem is left to the reader.</p></proof></theorem>
<p>One of the most significant facts about minsets is that any subset of <m>A</m> that can be obtained
from  \(B_1\), \(B_2\) \(\ldots\), \(B_n\), using the standard set operations can be obtained in a standard form by taking the union of selected minsets.</p>
<definition xml:id="def-minset-normal-form"><title>Minset Normal Form</title>
<idx>Minset Normal Form</idx>
<statement><p>A set is said to be in minset normal form when it is expressed as the union of zero or more distinct nonempty minsets.</p>
</statement></definition>
<p>Notes:</p>
<p><ul>
<li><p> The union of zero sets is the empty set, <m>\emptyset</m>.</p></li>
<li><p> Minset normal form is also called <term>canonical form</term>.</p></li>
</ul></p>

<example xml:id="ex-concrete-minsets-2"><title>Another Concrete Example of Minsets</title><p> Let \(U = \{-2,-1,0,1,2\}\), \(B_1= \{0,1,2\}\), and \(B_2= \{0,2\}\).  Then</p>
<table><caption/>
<tabular halign="center">
<row><cell>\(B_1\cap B_2=\{0,2\}\) </cell></row> 
<row><cell>\(B_1^c\cap B_2 = \emptyset\) </cell></row> 
<row><cell>\(B_1\cap B_2^c = \{1\}\) </cell></row> 
<row><cell>\(B_1^c\cap B_2^c = \{-2,-1\}\) </cell></row> 
</tabular>
</table>
<p>In this case, there are only three nonempty minsets, producing the partition \(\{\{0,2\},\{1\},\{-2,-1\}\}\). An example of a set that could not be produced from just \(B_1\) and \(B_2\) is the set of even elements of <m>U</m>, \(\{-2,0,2\}\). This is because \(-2\) and \(-1\) cannot be separated. They are in the same minset and any union of minsets either includes or excludes them both.  In general, there are \(2^3= 8\) different minset normal forms because there are three nonempty minsets. This means that only 8 of the \(2^5=32\) subsets of <m>U</m> could be generated from  any two sets \(B_1\) and \(B_2\). </p>

<answer><p> Let \(a\in A\). For each \(i\), \(a\in B_i\), or \(a\in B_i{}^c\), since \(B_i\cup B_i{}^c=A\) by the complement law. Let \(D_i=B_i\) if \(a\in B_i\), and \(D=B_i{}^c\) otherwise. Since \(a\) is in each \(D_i\), it must be in the minset \(D_1\cap  D_2 \cdots \cap D_n\). Now consider two different minsets \(M_1= D_1\cap D_2\cdots \cap D_n\), and \(M_2=G_1\cap G_2\cdots \cap G_n\), where each \(D_i\) and \(G_i\) is either \(B_i\) or \(B_i{}^c\). Since these minsets are not equal, \(D_i\neq G_i\), for some \(i\). Therefore, \(M_1\cap M_2=D_1\cap  D_2 \cdots \cap D_n\cap G_1\cap G_2\cdots \cap G_n=\emptyset\), since two of the sets in the intersection are disjoint. Since every element of A is in a minset and the minsets are disjoint, the nonempty minsets must form a partition of A. <m>\square</m></p>

<exercise number="8"><statement><p> Let <m>S</m> be a finite set of <m>n</m> elements. Let \(B_i\) ,, i = 1, 2, \ldots  , <m>k</m> be nonempty subsets of <m>S</m>. There are \(2^{2^k}\) minset normal forms generated by the <m>k</m> subsets. The number of subsets of <m>S</m> is \(2^n\). Since we can make \(2^{2^k} > 2^n\) by choosing \(k \geq  \log _2 n\), it is clear that two distinct minset normal-form expressions do not always equal distinct subsets of <m>S</m>. Even for \(k &lt; \log _2 n\), it may happen that two distinct minset normal-form expressions equal the same subset of <m>S</m>.
