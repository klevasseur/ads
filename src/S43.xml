<p>Let <m>B_1</m> and <m>B_2</m> be subsets of a set <m>A</m>. Notice that the Venn diagram of <xref ref="fig-minsets-2" text="type-global" /> is naturally partitioned into the subsets <m>A_1</m>, <m>A_2</m>, <m>A_3</m>, and <m>A_4</m>. Further we observe that <m>A_1</m>, <m>A_2</m>, <m>A_3</m>, and <m>A_4</m> can be described in terms of <m>B_1</m> and <m>B_2</m> as follows:</p>

<p>Each <m>A_i</m> is called a minset generated by <m>B_1</m> and <m>B_2</m>. We note that each minset is formed by taking the intersection of two sets where each may be either <m>B_k</m> or its complement, <m>B_k^c</m>. Note also, given two sets, there are <m>2^{2}=4</m> minsets.</p>
<p>Minsets are occasionally called <em>minterms</em>.</p>
<p>The reader should note that if we apply all possible combinations of the operations intersection, union, and complementation to the sets <m>B_1</m> and <m>B_2</m> of <xref ref="fig-minsets-2" text="type-local"/>, the smallest sets generated will be exactly the minsets, the minimum sets. Hence the derivation of the term minset.</p>
<p>Next, consider the Venn diagram containing three sets, <m>B_1</m>, <m>B_2</m>, and <m>B_3</m>. Draw it right now and count the regions! 
What are the minsets generated by <m>B_1</m>, <m>B_2</m>, and <m>B_3</m>? How many are there? Following the procedures outlined above, we note that the following are three of the <m>2^3=8</m> minsets. What are the others?</p>

<statement><p>Let <m>\{B_1, B_2,\ldots,B_n\}</m> be a set of subsets of  set <m>A</m>. Sets of the form <m>D_1\cap D_2\cap

<example xml:id="ex-minset-example"><title>A concrete example of some minsets</title><p>Consider the following concrete example. Let <m>A = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}</m> with subsets <m>B_1 = \{1,3,5\}</m> and <m>B_2= \{1,2,3\}</m>. How can we use set operations applied to <m>B_1</m> and <m>B_2</m> and produce a list of sets that contain elements of <m>A</m> efficiently
without duplication? As a first attempt, we might try these three sets:</p>
<table xml:id="tab-subsets-generated-1"><title/>
<tabular halign="center">
<row><cell><m>B_1\cap B_2=\{1,3\}</m></cell></row>
<row><cell><m>B_1^c=\{2,4,6\}</m></cell></row>
<row><cell><m>B_2^c=\{4,5,6\}</m>.</cell></row>
</tabular>
</table>

<p>We have produced all elements of <m>A</m> but we have 4 and 6 repeated in two sets. In place of <m>B_1^c</m> and <m>B_2^c</m>, let's try <m>B_1^c\cap B_2</m> and <m>B_1\cap B_2^c</m>, respectively:</p>
<table xml:id="tab-subsets-generated-2"><title/>
<tabular halign="center">
<row><cell><m>B_1^c\cap B_2=\{2\}</m> and</cell></row>
<row><cell><m>B_1\cap B_2^c=\{5\}</m>.</cell></row>
</tabular>
</table>
<p>We have now produced the elements 1, 2, 3, and 5 using <m>B_1\cap B_2</m>,  <m>B_1^c\cap B_2</m> and <m>B_1\cap B_2^c</m> yet we have not listed the elements 4 and 6. Most ways that we could combine <m>B_1</m> and <m>B_2</m> such as <m>B_1\cup B_2</m> or <m>B_1\cup B_2^c</m> will produce duplications of listed
elements and will not produce both 4 and 6. However we note that <m>B_1^c\cap B_2^c= \{4, 6\}</m>, exactly the elements we need.  Each element of <m>A</m> appears exactly once in one of the four minsets <m>B_1\cap B_2</m> ,  <m>B_1^c\cap B_2</m>, <m>B_1\cap B_2^c</m> and <m>B_1^c\cap B_2^c</m>. Hence, we have a partition of <m>A</m>.</p>

<theorem xml:id="th-minset-partition"><title>Minset Partition Theorem</title><statement><p> Let <m>A</m> be a set and let <m>B_1</m>, <m>B_2</m> <m>\ldots</m>  , <m>B_n</m> be subsets of <m>A</m>. The set of nonempty minsets generated by  <m>B_1</m>, <m>B_2</m> <m>\ldots</m>  , <m>B_n</m> is a partition of <m>A</m>.</p>
</statement><proof><p>The proof of this theorem is left to the reader.</p></proof></theorem>
<p>One of the most significant facts about minsets is that any subset of <m>A</m> that can be obtained
from  <m>B_1</m>, <m>B_2</m> <m>\ldots</m>, <m>B_n</m>, using the standard set operations can be obtained in a standard form by taking the union of selected minsets.</p>
<definition xml:id="def-minset-normal-form"><title>Minset Normal Form</title>
<idx>Minset Normal Form</idx>
<statement><p>A set is said to be in minset normal form when it is expressed as the union of zero or more distinct nonempty minsets.</p>
</statement></definition>
<p>Notes:</p>
<p><ul>
<li><p> The union of zero sets is the empty set, <m>\emptyset</m>.</p></li>
<li><p> Minset normal form is also called <term>canonical form</term>.</p></li>
</ul></p>

<example xml:id="ex-concrete-minsets-2"><title>Another Concrete Example of Minsets</title><p> Let <m>U = \{-2,-1,0,1,2\}</m>, <m>B_1= \{0,1,2\}</m>, and <m>B_2= \{0,2\}</m>.  Then</p>
<table><title/>
<tabular halign="center">
<row><cell><m>B_1\cap B_2=\{0,2\}</m> </cell></row> 
<row><cell><m>B_1^c\cap B_2 = \emptyset</m> </cell></row> 
<row><cell><m>B_1\cap B_2^c = \{1\}</m> </cell></row> 
<row><cell><m>B_1^c\cap B_2^c = \{-2,-1\}</m> </cell></row> 
</tabular>
</table>
<p>In this case, there are only three nonempty minsets, producing the partition <m>\{\{0,2\},\{1\},\{-2,-1\}\}</m>. An example of a set that could not be produced from just <m>B_1</m> and <m>B_2</m> is the set of even elements of <m>U</m>, <m>\{-2,0,2\}</m>. This is because <m>-2</m> and <m>-1</m> cannot be separated. They are in the same minset and any union of minsets either includes or excludes them both.  In general, there are <m>2^3= 8</m> different minset normal forms because there are three nonempty minsets. This means that only 8 of the <m>2^5=32</m> subsets of <m>U</m> could be generated from  any two sets <m>B_1</m> and <m>B_2</m>. </p>

Let <m>D_i=B_i</m> if <m>a\in B_i</m>, and <m>D=B_i{}^c</m> otherwise. Since <m>a</m> is in each <m>D_i</m>, it must be in the minset <m>D_1\cap  D_2 \cdots \cap D_n</m>.
