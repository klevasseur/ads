<p>Let <m>B_1</m> and <m>B_2</m> be subsets of a set <m>A</m>. Notice that the Venn diagram of <xref ref="fig-minsets-2" text="type-global" /> is naturally partitioned into the subsets <m>A_1</m>, <m>A_2</m>, <m>A_3</m>, and <m>A_4</m>. Further we observe that <m>A_1</m>, <m>A_2</m>, <m>A_3</m>, and <m>A_4</m> can be described in terms of <m>B_1</m> and <m>B_2</m> as follows:</p>

<p>Each <m>A_i</m> is called a minset generated by <m>B_1</m> and <m>B_2</m>. We note that each minset is formed by taking the intersection of two sets where each may be either <m>B_k</m> or its complement, <m>B_k^c</m>. Note also, given two sets, there are <m>2^{2}=4</m> minsets.</p>
<p>Minsets are occasionally called <em>minterms</em>.</p>
<p>The reader should note that if we apply all possible combinations of the operations intersection, union, and complementation to the sets <m>B_1</m> and <m>B_2</m> of <xref ref="fig-minsets-2" text="type-local"/>, the smallest sets generated will be exactly the minsets, the minimum sets. Hence the derivation of the term minset.</p>
<p>Next, consider the Venn diagram containing three sets, <m>B_1</m>, <m>B_2</m>, and <m>B_3</m>. Draw it right now and count the regions! 
What are the minsets generated by <m>B_1</m>, <m>B_2</m>, and <m>B_3</m>? How many are there? Following the procedures outlined above, we note that the following are three of the <m>2^3=8</m> minsets. What are the others?</p>

<example xml:id="ex-minset-example"><title>A concrete example of some minsets</title><p>Consider the following example. Let <m>A = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}</m> with subsets <m>B_1 = \{1,3,5\}</m> and <m>B_2= \{1,2,3\}</m>. How can we use set operations to  produce a partition of <m>A</m>? As a first attempt, we might try these three sets:</p>
<table xml:id="tab-subsets-generated-1"><title/>
<tabular halign="center">
<row><cell><m>B_1\cap B_2=\{1,3\}</m></cell></row>
<row><cell><m>B_1^c=\{2,4,6\}</m></cell></row>
<row><cell><m>B_2^c=\{4,5,6\}</m>.</cell></row>
</tabular>
</table>
<p>We have produced all elements of <m>A</m> but we have 4 and 6 repeated in two sets. In place of <m>B_1^c</m> and <m>B_2^c</m>, let's try <m>B_1^c\cap B_2</m> and <m>B_1\cap B_2^c</m>, respectively:</p>
<table xml:id="tab-subsets-generated-2"><title/>
<tabular halign="center">
<row><cell><m>B_1^c\cap B_2=\{2\}</m> and</cell></row>
<row><cell><m>B_1\cap B_2^c=\{5\}</m>.</cell></row>
</tabular>
</table>
<p>We have now produced the elements 1, 2, 3, and 5 using <m>B_1\cap B_2</m>,  <m>B_1^c\cap B_2</m> and <m>B_1\cap B_2^c</m> yet we have not listed the elements 4 and 6. Most ways that we could combine <m>B_1</m> and <m>B_2</m> such as <m>B_1\cup B_2</m> or <m>B_1\cup B_2^c</m> will produce duplications of listed
elements and will not produce both 4 and 6. However we note that <m>B_1^c\cap B_2^c= \{4, 6\}</m>, exactly the elements we need.</p>
<p>After more experimenting, we might reach a conclusion that each element of <m>A</m> appears exactly once in one of the four minsets <m>B_1\cap B_2</m> ,  <m>B_1^c\cap B_2</m>, <m>B_1\cap B_2^c</m> and <m>B_1^c\cap B_2^c</m>. Hence, we have a partition of <m>A</m>. In fact this is the finest partition of <m>A</m> in that all other partitions we could generate consist of selected unions of these minsets.</p>
<p> At this point, we might ask and be able to answer the question <q>How many different subsets of our universe can we generate from  <m>B_1</m> and <m>B_2</m>?</q>  The answer is <m>2^{\textrm{number of nonempty minsets}}</m>, which is <m>2^4=16</m> in this case.  Notice that in general, it would be impossible to find two sets from which we could generate all subsets of <m>A=\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}</m> since there will never be more than four nonempty minsets.   If we allowed ourselves three subsets and tried to generate all sets from them, then the number of minsets would be <m>2^3 =8</m>.  With only six elements in <m>A</m>, there could be six minsets, each containing a single element.  In that case we could generate the whole power set of <m>A</m>.</p>

<theorem xml:id="th-minset-partition"><title>Minset Partition Theorem</title><statement><p> Let <m>A</m> be a set and let <m>B_1</m>, <m>B_2</m> <m>\ldots</m>  , <m>B_n</m> be subsets of <m>A</m>. The set of nonempty minsets generated by  <m>B_1</m>, <m>B_2</m> <m>\ldots</m>  , <m>B_n</m> is a partition of <m>A</m>.</p>
</statement><proof><p>The proof of this theorem is left to the reader.</p></proof></theorem>
<p>One of the most significant facts about minsets is that any subset of <m>A</m> that can be obtained
from  <m>B_1</m>, <m>B_2</m> <m>\ldots</m>, <m>B_n</m>, using the standard set operations can be obtained in a standard form by taking the union of selected minsets.</p>
<definition xml:id="def-minset-normal-form"><title>Minset Normal Form</title>
<idx>Minset Normal Form</idx>
<statement><p>A set is said to be in minset normal form when it is expressed as the union of zero or more distinct nonempty minsets.</p>
</statement></definition>
<p>Notes:</p>
<p><ul>
<li><p> The union of zero sets is the empty set, <m>\emptyset</m>.</p></li>
<li><p> Minset normal form is also called <term>canonical form</term>.</p></li>
</ul></p>

<definition xml:id="def-compact-Minset"><title>Compact Minset Notation</title><idx>Compact Minset Notation</idx>
<statement><p>Let <m>\{B_1, B_2,\ldots,B_n\}</m> be a set of subsets of  set <m>A</m>. If <m>b</m> is equal to 0 or 1 and <m>C</m> is any set, then <m>C^{(b)}</m> is defined to be <m>C</m> if <m>b=1</m> and <m>C^c</m> if <m>b=0</m>.  Then we can denote a minset compactly as an expression <m>M_{b_1 b_2 \dots b_n}</m> where 
		<me>M_{b_1 b_2 \dots b_n} = B_1^{b_1} \cap B_2^{b_2} \cap \cdots \cap B_n^{b_n} </me>
</p></statement></definition>

<example xml:id="ex-concrete-minsets-2"><title>Another Concrete Example of Minsets</title><p> Let <m>U = \{-2,-1,0,1,2\}</m>, <m>B_1= \{0,1,2\}</m>, and <m>B_2= \{0,2\}</m>.  Then</p>
<table><title/>
<tabular halign="center">
<row><cell><m>M_{11}=B_1\cap B_2=\{0,2\}</m> </cell></row> 
<row><cell><m>M_{01}=B_1^c\cap B_2 = \emptyset</m> </cell></row> 
<row><cell><m>M_{10}=B_1\cap B_2^c = \{1\}</m> </cell></row> 
<row><cell><m>M_{00}=B_1^c\cap B_2^c = \{-2,-1\}</m> </cell></row> 
</tabular>
</table>
<p>In this case, there are only three nonempty minsets, producing the partition <m>\{\{0,2\},\{1\},\{-2,-1\}\}</m>. An example of a set that could not be produced from just <m>B_1</m> and <m>B_2</m> is the set of even elements of <m>U</m>, <m>\{-2,0,2\}</m>. This is because <m>-2</m> and <m>-1</m> cannot be separated. They are in the same minset and any union of minsets either includes or excludes them both.  In general, there are <m>2^3= 8</m> different minset normal forms because there are three nonempty minsets. This means that only 8 of the <m>2^5=32</m> subsets of <m>U</m> could be generated from  any two sets <m>B_1</m> and <m>B_2</m>. </p>
