<body><article class="example example-like"><p>Suppose that you would like to mechanically describe the set of strings of 0's and 1's having no consecutive 1's. One way to visualize a string of this kind is with the graph in <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-directed-graph-ex1.html" title="Figure 9.1.4">Figure 9.1.4</a>. Consider any path starting at vertex \(s\text{.}\) If the label on each graph is considered to be the output to a printer, then the output will have no consecutive 1's. For example, the path that is described by the vertex list \((s,a, b, b, a, b, b, a, b)\) would result in an output of \(10010010\text{.}\) Conversely, any string with  no consecutive 1's determines a path starting at s.</p></article></body>
