<body><article class="example-like"><p>It was determined that all junior computer science majors take at least one of the following courses: Algorithms, Logic Design, and Compiler Construction. Assume the number in each course was 75, 60 and 55, respectively for the three courses listed. Further investigation indicated ten juniors took all three courses, twenty-five took  Algorithms and Logic Design, twelve took Algorithms and Compiler Construction, and fifteen took Logic Design and Compiler Construction. How many junior C.S. majors are there?</p>
<p><a data-knowl="./knowl/student-counting-disjoint.html" title="Example 2.3.6: Counting Students in Disjoint Classes">Example 2.3.6</a> was a simple application of the law of addition, however in this example some students are taking two or more courses, so a simple application of the law of addition would lead to double or triple counting. We rephrase information in the language of sets to describe the situation more explicitly.</p>
<p>\(A\) = the set of all junior computer science majors</p>
<p>\(A_1\) = the set of all junior computer science majors who took Algorithms</p>
<p>\(A_2\) = the set of all junior computer science majors who took Logic Design</p>
<p>\(A_3\) = the set of all junior computer science majors who took Compiler Construction</p>
<p>Since all junior CS majors must take at least one of the courses, the number we want is:</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\lvert A \rvert = \lvert A_1 \cup A_2 \cup A_3 \rvert = \lvert A_1 \rvert + \lvert A_2 \rvert + \lvert A_3 \rvert - \textrm{repeats}.
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>A Venn diagram is helpful to visualize the problem. In this case the universal set \(U\)  can stand for 	all students in the university.</p>

<figcaption><span class="type">Figure</span> <span class="codenumber">2.3.8.</span> Venn Diagram</figcaption></figure><p>We see that the whole universal set is naturally partitioned into subsets that are labeled by the numbers 1 through 8, and the set \(A\)  is  partitioned into subsets labeled 1 through 7. The region labeled 8 represents all students who are not junior CS majors.  Note also that students in the subsets labeled 2, 3, and 4 are double counted, and those in the subset labeled 1 are triple counted. To adjust, we must subtract the numbers in regions 2, 3 and 4.  This can be done by subtracting the numbers in the intersections of each pair of sets.  However, the individuals in region 1 will have been removed three times, just as they had been originally added three times.  Therefore, we must finally add their number back in.</p>
